Reliqui vero sacerdotes . . . tangant. This clause is omitted by
Egb., Lan, and D.; it is found in the same extract from the Statuta
in the Gelasian Sacramentary, but not in Missale Francorum. Its
insertion is probably due to an early error in the text of the Statuto.

p. 120. Oremus dileotissimi. This is a variation of one of the initial
prayers in the leonine and Gelasian Sacramentaries.

Exaudi domine praees. This is not in the early Sacramentaries,
but appears in Egb. as A lia benedictio draconi sive diaconissae.

Domine deus . . . preces nostras. This is common to the Leonine
and Gregorian Sacramentaries.

p. 122. Consecrantur manus. This form occurs (with very slight variation)
in the Gelasian Sacramentary at the end of the forms for Subdeacons,
where (as Tommasi remarked) it is evidently misplaced. The anointing
of the hands of Deacons seems to have been used in England, and to
have been not unknown in France‚ where the Archbishop of Bourges,
about 860, addressed an inquiry as to its propriety to Pope Nicolas 1,
and received the reply that at Rome neither Deacons nor Priests were
thus anointed (Martene, De Ant. Eccl. Rit, vol. ii. p. 22).

pp. 122-125. This section follows very nearly the same order which is found
in Egb., Claud, Lan, D., T.‚ and the Sidney Sussex MS. The Leonine
Sacramentary has the first three prayers of Rob., and those only; the
Gelasian adds the two which stand last in Rob. In Egb. these stand
in the same order as in the Gelasian Sacramentary, without break, the
direction as to the changing of the stole being placed, with its formula,
before the first of the prayers, the other additions after the last of them.
lu the other books of the group, as in Rob., the later additions, except
that of the changing of the stole, are placed between the Leonine forms
and those which the Gelasian Sacramentary adds to them.

p. 122. Presbyter oum ordinatur, etc. All the books of the group have
this extract from the Statuta Ecclesiae Antiqua. Egb., D., and Lan.
combine with it a direction as to the putting on of the stole, and as to
the mention of the priest's “title''

p. 123. Hie mutetur stola. Egb. omits this. Lan. and D. have before
the corresponding rubric the form Stolo iustitiae circumdet, etc.. which
Egb. places after the initial rubric. T. has at the same point Tollite
ru m.

{tesedia domiue. Lan. and D. omit this form with the rubric or
heading preceding it. ln Egb. the vesting with the chasuble precedes
the anointing‚ both being placed later.

p. 124. Consecratio manuum sacerdotis ds oleo et crismate. Lan. and
D. omit the last four words. Egb. (which entitles the preceding prayer
Consecratio manus) has here a rubria directing that the sign of the cross
is to be made with chrism upon the hands.

Tune vestietur oestrla. ln Egb. the vesting with the chasuble is
accompanied by the words, Induat te dominus vestimento salutis et
coronam luetitr‘aeponat super caput tuum. There is an alternative form
of benediction, which does not appear iu the other books. Lan. has a
form for use at the vesting (Pertinet indumento, etc.) which is not in
any of the other books of the group. ln the Sidney Sussex MS. the
direction for the vesting with the chasuble is omitted, but the vesting
is referred to, as in Rob., in the benediction which follows the
action.

p. ης. The reading et per obsequium pleon tuoe corpore et sauguine filii
tui inmaculata benedictione transformetur od irrvr’olabilem caritatem is
perhaps the result of an attempt to improve the text. Claud. has
corpus etsauguiue . . . transformetur.

pp. 125-130. Ordinatio Episcopi. lu this section there is rather more
