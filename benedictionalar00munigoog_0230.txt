NOTES.

variation among the MSS. which contain it than in the sections pre·
ceding it. The initial rubric varies a good deal in form. ln Egb. and
Lan. it is more nearly identical with the corresponding passage in the
Sintula Ecclesiae Antiqua than is the case in D., Rob., and T. The
three prayers which follow are common to the whole group. Egb. adds
a fourth (Exaudi domine preces), which in the Leonine Sacramentary
and in Missale Francorum appears to be the collect oi the mass, and
in the Gelasian Sacramentary takes the place which in the five English
books is occupied by Adesto supplicationibus. ln Egb. it is directed
that the initial prayers are to be said by all the bishops; a parently ,

p. 125. Deus honorum omnium. This, in the early Sacramentaries and
in Egb. and Lan, forms, together with Hoc domim copiose, one con-
tinuous prayer not broken by any direction for anointing.

p. 126. Ele cfihndatur oleum, etc. Though Egb. has no mention oi
anointing here, its use may be indicated by crosses which arc marked
in the text. ln Lan. the anointing oi the head follows at the end oi
the whole prayer, with the use oi the formula Unguatur ei sanctificetur,
which the correction made by a later hand in Rob. would insert at this
point in the Consecrctrb. The Codex S. Eligii and Hittorp's Ordo
Romanus agree in inserting Urggwaiur et sanctificetur here, but direct
tiiquif oi chrism. D. and T. agree with the original arrangement

Hoc domine copiose. ln this portion of the prayer there is a
marked differente between the texts. The Leonine form differs from
the Gelasian in the omission os certain passages. Egb. and Lan. follow
the Leonine; D., Rob.. and T. the longer form contained in the Gelasian
Sacramentary and in Misscle Francorum.

p. 127. Peter sancte omnipotens deus. This prayer is not found in the
earliest Sacramentaries‚ and is absent from Egb., but appears in Lan,
D., and T. lt maintains its place in the later English Pontificals but
does not seem to have been usual elsewhere. Menard appears to have
found it only in books of English origin and in the Codex lietoldi, which
seems to have been influenced by English sources. But it appears also
in the non-English part oi the Leofric Missal, where it precedes Deus
honorum omnium and has the title oi consecratio. Possibly its original
source may be the same which supplied the Gelasian additions to the
Leonine forms ior the Ordination of Priests and Deacons.

The use oi chrism for this anointing is not mentioned in the rubric of
Egb. or Lan, but seems to be implied in the text oi the accompanying
formula. Egb. adds a shorter alternative formula, in which there is no
mention of chrism.

Hic mittatpr oleum, etc. This occurs earlier in Lan. (see above,

Accipe baculum sacri regiminis. This is absent in Egb. and Lan,
