NOTES.

order in which the cardinal points are taken. The prayers stand in
the same order in all the books, and the differente as to the points at
which they are said may be merely arbitrary.

The mass is the same in all the later books, except that 44 adds an
Episcopal benediction, and makes the Super populum a second collect.

ln Egb. and Claud. the first collect is the same as in Rob., but the
other prayers differ. There is no proper preface or Super populum.

pp. 103-105. Ad signum molesios benedicendum. This Order is practi-
cally the same iu Egb., Claud .‚ Lars, D. The last two are more nearly
in exact agreement with Rob. than Egb. and Claud. The rubrics are
not exactly the same in any two of the five, but agree as to their general
sense. The first prayer in Rob. is a benediction of the water ; and so
also in Claud. In Lan. and D. it is a form used in the washing of the
bell, and begins Benedic domine hoc signum . . . et assistat super illud.
This isa variation recognized by alternative readings in Egb. and 146.
Claud. has no anthems attached to the psalms, beginning the psalm
at the anointing at Vox domini super aquas, that at the fumigatson at
Viderunt te aquae. Egb. has the anthem Loudet animo mea in place
of lu civitate ’doun'm', which in D. is added in the margin. In2146
tbe office begins with an adaptation of the Euormsmus aquae for the
dedication of a church. ln 44 the Euorcrsmus aquae is preceded
by alitany: the water is then sprinkled upon the bell with the anthem
Asperges, 'and the bell is blessed with the form Benedic domine uoc
tintinnabulum, differing slightly from the Beuedr'c domiue hoe signum
of the earlier books: the Order ends with a benediction pronounced
elevata manu. As in the text of the rubrics, so also in the prayers, the
various books are not in exact verbal agreement.

pp. 106-108. consecratio amois. This Order is almost identical in D. and
Rob.,which combine with some additions the different elements of Egb.
and Claud. ln Egb. the office begins with Asperges, and the anthem
is followed by three prayers: Deus gloriae (including the section
Radiet tu‘c, which in Rob. is separated and placed at the end, for nse if
the case requires it) 3 Benedic domiue hanc crucem,· and Rogamus te.
These are the first three prayers also in Ι)., where Radiet he'r, though
not separated from the rest of the prayer, is marked as intended for
occasional use only. Claud. omits the anthem and Deus gloriae, but
adds after Rogamus te (with the title os Consecratio crucis) the prayer
Omnipotens aeterne deus pater, which in D. and Rob. stands fourth.
Neither Egbnor Clauddirects the anointing of the cross. D. and Rob.
order the use of chrism for this purpose: Rob. directs the anointing to
be accompanied by the words Consecrare et sanctificare degeneres, etc.
After the anointing follow in D. and Rob. the two prayerS, Omnipotens
sempiterne deus qui per lignum and Deus cui cunctae .· and with the last
of these the office ends in both ; for Radiet hic, though it stands last in
Rob., was probably meant to be annexed to the prayer Deus glom'o in
those cases which required its use.

In Lan. the material is nearly the same, but the arrangement differs
considerably. Three prayers (Benedic domine hauc crucem, Rogamus
te domine, and Omnipotens sempiterne deus qui per liguum) precede the
washing of the cross. The anthem Asperges is not mentioned. The
washing is followed by the prayer Omnipotens aeterne deus pater.
The cross is censed, and after the prayer Deus gloriae (to which
Radiet liic is annexed for use if required) it is anointed with holy oil;
the words at the anointing are the same as in Rob. After the anointing
follows a prayer which does not appear in Egb., Claud, Ι)., Rob.
(Sanctifica quaesumus), and the prayer Deus cui creurtae which is the
last of the series, as in D. and Rob.
