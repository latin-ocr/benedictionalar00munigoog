xviii PREFACE.

Lanaletense both retain what seems to have been the older order,
which probably stood in the books from which they were copied.
They seem, when regarded as the representatives ot' those older
books, to take their place within, and at the beginning of, the
series of English Pontificals which illustrate the variations of

usage, and the development of this class os Servicebooks, not
only in England, but also in the neighbouring parts ot' the
Continent, in the period before the Norman Conquest.

In the notes on the Pontifical offices contained in the present
volume an attempt has been made to indicate the extent and
character os the variations which the books of this group display
with regard to the arrangement of each of the offices. The
differences are sor the most part unimportant: nor do they
'serve to furnish sufficient grounds for any very exact conclu-
sions as to the mutual relation of the books. Where two or
more ol the MSS. are found, as sometimes happens, to be in
very close agreement in regard to some portions of their con·
tents, it will generally appear that, in regard to some other
portion, they diverge, and one or other of them agrees with
some other member ol the larger group.

The “Pontifical of Egbert,” while the date of the book from
which it is copied (assuming that it is directly derived, at least
in the main, from a single earlier MS.) cannot be accurately
determined, seems to represent an earlier stage than any other
book of the group which has come down to us in a form practi-
cally complete. Two fragmentary Pontificals seem, however,
to stand near it: one of these, the earliest1 of the fragments now
combined in the British Museum MS. Claudius A. iii, shows a
close affinity to it in certain respects3 and the Sidney Sussex
College MS. Δ. 5. 15, which contains (oi matter common to
other books of the group) only forms relating to Ordination, is
in almost exact agreement, so sar as these forms extend, with
the early portion of MS. Claudius A. ἰὶἰ.2

The original portions ol pontificale Lanaletmse,³ the “ Pontifical

Edgar at Bath in 973, rather than with the crowning oi either os Edgar's sons.
S. Dunstan was the officiant at all three coronations, and it is perhaps more likely
that he followed in the later cases the sarnc order which was employed in the
coronation os Eugar than that he adopted a new order either lor Edward or for
Ethelred. The crowning ol Edgar was an occasion when a new order may well
have been adopted, and the lact that it was long delayed allowed more time ior the
preplaffition ol a carefully constructed order than would in ordinary cases have been
avplaepglude lor this purpose the collection ol Episcopal Benedictions which forms
part of the same volume, a portion oi which may perhaps be earlier than any of the
