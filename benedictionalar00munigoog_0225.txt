ln 146 and in the Pontifical of S. Thomas, as in Lan, the anointing
is with holy oil. In both some additional anthems are introduced, and
also one or two additional prayers. In the Pontifical of S. Thomas
Omnipotens aeterne deas pater appears as Consecratio cruces followed by
Deus gloriose excelse (the same prayer as Deus gloriae with some
variatione) as Benedictio 1111111. In 146 Dens gloriae is placed at the
end of the office, to be used if the cross is adorned with gold or gems.
In 44 the order is further developed, with still more additional material
than in 146. Here also the ancinting is with holy oil.

pp. 108-110. Benedictio scrinii. In this section D., Lan, 146 are in close
agreement with Rob. The Pontifical of S. Thomas and 44 have the
same prayers, but add anthems, in which they do not exactly agree
together. Egb. and Claud. have not this office.

p. 110. Dedicatto fontis. The three prayers under this head are originally

is the first collect, the second the post·communion, and the third a
lengthened form of the second collect 01 the Gelasian mass (Muratori‚
Lit. Rom. Vei, i. 618, 6193 or pp. 142, 143 of the Oxford edition).
Egb. has the Gelasian mass, omitting the preface and Hanc egitur, and
by a clerical error giving to the secret the title of Post communionem.
Claud. has only the first two prayers of those iu Rob. ε 44 has the first
aud third, followed by a mass which contains some of the remaining
Gelasian material. Lan. and D. agree with Rob.

pp. 110-113.Reconciliatio loci sacri. ln this section Rob. agrees
throughout with D. lan. has two forms: one consists of the prayers
which in Rob. and D. precede the mass: parts of the mass also appear
elsewhere. The other (Laui) consiste 01 anthems and psalms, followed
bya mass nearly agreeing with that in Rob. and D. The differences
are noted below. Egb. and Claud. have two out 01 the three prayers
(omitting Deus qui in sanctes) and a mass agreeing with Rob. and Ι).,
but less completely set out. In 146 the three prayers are to be preceded
hya litany: the mass is nearly the same asin Rob. and D. A
commendatio lori is added at the end of the section.

pp. 112, 113. Missa ln reconciliatione ecclesiae. The mass in Lan.²has
three collecte, the second being Dens qui dixisti: the first isa form not
found in the other books, beginning Dens indultor criminum. Lan.2
has for the Epistle a passage from 1 Cor. iii. (Unusquisque mercedem . . .
qnasi per ignem): 146 substitutes a lesson from lsai. (levamini . . .
comedetis). Egb. and Claud. do not specify the Epistle or Gospel. In
the grail, 146 has as Y. Adorabo ad templum. The preface is omitted
in Egb. and Claud. The text of the benediction in Egb. does not
exactly agree with Rob., but the benediction is 011 the whole the same.
For the communion Egb. has Acceptabilis; but this is probably only
a clerical error, or erhaps the consequence 01 1 clerical error in an
early source. As tie post-communion, Lan.² has Sanctorum tuorum
domine precibus confidentes.

p. 113. Oratio ad capillaturam. This is common to all the books : in 44
it is the second 01 two prayers 101 this purpose.

p. 114. Ad clericum faciendum. This section agrees closely with Lan,
save that Lan. gives an alternative authem. D. omits the prayer
Deus caius Spiritu, but otherwise agrees with Rob. τ Claud. omits both
Deus cuens Spiritu (which it has elsewhere) and Deus qui ecclesiam:
it omits also Omnipotens sempiterne deas propitiare, and adds other
anthems (T u es Domine, etc.) at the giving 01 the tonsure. ln 146 and
in the Pontifical of S. Thomas the order is rather more developed, with
an increase in the number both of anthems and prayers. The two
