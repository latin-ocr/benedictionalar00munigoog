170 roras.

9. The Bodleian MS. (canonici) Liturg. 326, an rrth-century Benedictional,
apparently from the neighbourhood of Verona, cited as 326.

These three (cited collectively as “group B'’) are in frequent agreement
with the former group. The Benedictional of S. Thierry shows a special
resemblance to AEtb, since it contains a large number of forms which occur
in AEth. but are not found in the other collections of groups A and B.

10. The Bpnedictious contained in vol. ii. of Pamelius’ liturgicon Latinum,
cite as Pam.

11. The Benedictions of the Leofric Missal, cited as Leofr.

12. The Benedictions of the Vatican MS, Ottob. 313, as shown in
Muratori liturgia Romana Vetus, vol. ii., cited as Ο.

13. The Benedictions of the Vatican MS. Reginae 337, as shown in tbe
same volume, cited as Vat.

14 The series of Benedictions from Kollar’s Analecta Vindobonensia,
reprinted in Migne’s Patrologziz Latina, vol. 78, cited as Koll.

The last four are cited collectively as “ group C.’'

15. The Bodleian MS. (canonici) Liturg. 329,a 15th·century Benedictional,
apparently from Treviso‚ cited as 329.

This Benedictional frequently agrees with Vat. in omitting forms common
to the other collections cited; but it does not so often agree in regard to the
form adopted as a substitute.

p. 4. The two benedictions on this page are a later addition. lhave not
found them elsewhere.

p. 5. In vigilia Natalis Domini. This is in all but Vat. r Pam. assigns it
to the Mass in gallicantu; in El, 326, 329, it is in nocte.

Ad missam in Nocte. This is not iu Egh.‚ but appears in the
others of group A. lt is also in Th. for the mass primo mane.

In primo mane. The loss of part of this henediction is probably
due to the removal of a leaf having on its verso a miniature facing the
next benedictino. The form is not in Egb., and the others of group Α,
which have it, do not agree in the text. M. and W. omit the clause
beginning Complector& while AEth. has a text which seems to be
{ompt'f lTl'he last two clauses (before Quod ipse) appear in Th. and

an. as o ows :-

Complectere hunc populum in ecclesiae sinu qui nobis processisti
Mariae de thalamo. Amen.

Sit haec plebs tuis praeceptis obedienter amabilis, sicut est partus
Virginis in origine singularis : ut cum dies tui fulgoris effulserit, invenias
{ln illislquod4 recondas in horreo, pro quibus dignatus es in carne venire
ecae o. men.

M. and W. divide the last clause, and vary the wording slightly.

p. 6. [Benedictio in dis] This is in all but Vat. and 3293 Egb. has
animarum for animalium in the second clause. .

hortavis domini ln allbut Vat. and 329. Senarr'i is the ordinary
reading instead of septenarii in the third clause.

Dom. i. post Natale Domini. This benediction is absent from Egb.,
which gives instead the henediction assigned in Rob. to the first Sunday
afterEpiphany. It is absent also from group C. In 329 it is assigned
to the first Sunday after Epiphany. The more usual reading in the
first clause is misit ut mundum salvaret.

p. 7. In Theophanis. Christi This is in all but Vat. and 329.

Dom. i. post Epiph. This is common to group A, group B, Pam,
and 329· Egb. em loys it for the first Sunday after ChristmaS, 329 for
the third Sunday ter Epiphany. Th, which reckons the Sundays after
