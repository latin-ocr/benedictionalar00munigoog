NOTES.

communionis sanctae lugeat amissione mulctatus’' (Cone. Tolet. viii.
ca .11.

'prbe irent clause, Ganecleus epsicopus duit . . . separabit, is from the
Second Council of Carthage. Possibly both have been extracted from
some catena of passages from conciliat decrees da conlnnpton'bus
cananum, in which the first ssage was drawn from the Seventh Council
of Toledo, the rest being re erred in error to the same source.

Diuinae trinitatis inseparabile numen. From this point to the
end of the section the source is the Eighth Council of Toledo, cap. 13.
The purpose of the extract is not evident; but it may perhaps have
been chosen as a model for the conclusion of the acts of a synod.

pp. 157-159. This Order for the investiture of the Duke of Normandy is

reprinted (from Du Chesne, Htst. Normannarum) by Martene, De
Antz'quis Eccl. Rilibns, vol. ii. p. 305. lt will be seen that it follows
the Order for the Coronation of a King, with necessary omissions and
some alterations of wording. The oath is the same: it is followed by
Te invocamus and Deus qni populas, substitutiug ducatus for ragnum
(even in the petition that the ‘sovereign may be brought ad aeternum
{tultis {hillidii tttthitlnttt‘ttlttttttttitt}
the ring and the girding ol the sword are adopted, with the same
substitution of ducatus for ragnum ,· the forms relating to the crowning
are omitted, and also those for the delivery of the sceptre and rod:
the last benedictiou is taken from one of the forms of benediction
preceding the enthronement. The enthronement and the benedictions
following it are not included.

The only additions are the anthem and verse after T a dcam laudamus
and the collect Omnipotens sempiterne dans quiritanti, which naturally
accompanies thern.

pp.160,161. Of the three benedictions contained in these pages the third

a pears also on p. 37 ; the first is in Lan. with omissions.

pp.1 2-165. In die Ordinationis Episcopi, etc. The whole of the

directions contained in the first twenty-seven lines of this section agree
with those in one of Martene’s Ordines (Da A nl. Eccl. Rit, vol. ii. p. 56)
taken from a Pontifical written for Besancon and afterwards adapted for
use at Tours. The date which Martene assigns to this book would make
it nearly contemporary with the writing of the section in Roh. The
Besancon Pontifical contains the full order of the Consecration: the
section in Rob. is evidently not intended to be complete in itself, but
to be taken in conjunction with the earlier Order which forms part of

· the original contents of the book (pp. 125-130). The earlier Order

contains no form of examination of the bishop-elect such as that which
in Hittorp’s Orda Romanas is described as secundum Gallorum institu-

, tiones, or as the forms which appear in the English Pontificals from the

12th century onwards. This omission is here supplied. The form of
examination differs in some respects from that contained in the Besancon
Pontifical: the exact form of questions is a matter on which there isa
considerable amount oivariation in different books. Before the questions
begin, the Besancon book directs the reading not only of the passage
from the spurious decretal os Anacletus‚ but also of a passage from the
letter of Celestine Ι. to the Bishops of Gaul (Nullas invitis detur
episcopas, etc.),o the fourth Nicene canon, and of a passage ex da'clt's·
Leonis papae, the extract from “ Anacletus '' being the last of the series.
The same combination occurs in other of Martene's texts; but the
passage from “Anacletus ’² sometimes appears alone. Sometimes even
this is omitted, and the only preface to the examination is the address
by the metropolitan, which as a rule begins with the words Antiqua
