advanced by Mr. Gage and approved by Professor Westwood,
that the volume was intended for the use of AEthelgar, some
time Abbot of the New Minster, who became Bishop of Selsey
in 980, and succeeded S. Dunstan in the throne of Canterbury
in 988, seems not unlikely to be correct; but there is no direct
evidence of its truth. The provision of benedictions for the
festivals of S. Grimbald and S. Judoc, which were probably not
generally observed outside the New Minster, might perhaps
suggest that the volume was intended for use in the New
Minster itself, and not for the use of a Bishop of Selsey or an
Archbishop of Canterbury.1

In the shorter of the two litanies mentioned above it is to
be observed that certain names are written in gold: they are
those of the Blessed Virgin Mary, S. Michael, S. Peter, S.
Bartholomew, and S. Denis. With regard to the first three of
these names, the fact of their being thus distinguished is hardly
remarkable; but the selection of the names of S. Bartholomew
and S. Denis, in a litany where the number of saints mentioned
by name in each group is so small as in this particular case,
is itself rather singular, and seems, when it is emphasized by
the distinction given to the names hythe use of gold, to demand
some attention² It can hardly, however, suggest any decided
inierence as to the place for which the book was originally
intended to serve, or modify the opinion which is formed on
other grounds asto the place where it was written. With
regard to the name of S. Denis, it seems most likely that the
importance given to it is the result of a temporary increase in
the cultus of the saint in England at the time to which the
book belongs. Such increased veneration of S. Denis may not
unreasonably be connected with what we leam as to the special
devotion with which the saint was regarded by S. Edith of
Wilton, and with the account of the vision of S. Dunstan, after
the death of S. Edith, in which S. Denis appeared as her

supposed, between 980 and 990, it would not be unlikely that

¹ The absence of any benediction for the festival of S. Swithun may perhaps point
in the same direction. Mr. Gnge mentions that on that day the monks of the New
Ι Minster attended the services in the Old Minster, while those of the Old Minster

cume to the New Minster on the festivals of S. Grimbald and S. Judoc.

² In the Benedictional proper, it may be noted, the first few lines of the form for
S. Bartholomew’s Day, and the Amen aster each of its clauses, are written in gold.
But this unusual treatment is perhaps due to the fact that the benedictino begins on
the same page which contains the latter part of the form for the festival of the
Assumption, which is written in gold throughout. So far as concerns the Amen, the
use of gold extends to some other benedictions which follow (see p. 4ο).
