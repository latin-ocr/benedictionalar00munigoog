atores, ’ 179

p. 78. Deinde incipiat, etc. Egb. and Claud. have no anthem or psalm at
this point: D. has only the first anthem and psalm: Lan. and 146
agree with the text : 44 adds after the psalm Magnus dominns a collect
Deus qui sanctum Moysen. Ramsey has a collect after each psalm, and
adds at the end of the section the anthem, psalm, and collect which 44
puts immediately before the Litany.

Benedicene salem et aquam cum cinere. The benedictions and
exorcisms which follow seem to be rather out of their natural sequence ;
but Claud. and 146 have them in the same order. Egb., Lan, and D.
place them in the order: (1) Exorczimus solis, (2) Benedictio solis,
(3) Exoroimus oquae, (4) Benedictio oquae, (ς) Benedictio cinerum.
Egb. has an alternative form for (1). Ramsey and 44 place (5) between
(a) and (3), and add words for use at the mingling of the ashes and salt,
and at the admixture of the wine. Ramsey has alternative forms for
the exorcism and benediction of the salt and water. The text of the
whole series of forms in 44 and Ramsey seems to have been retouched.

p. 80. Deus creator et conservator. Before this collect Ramsey inserts a
bidding of rayer (Deum omnipotentem srotnes carissimi): after it
Lan, [)., 146} 44, and Ramsey add a second collect (Domine dens rex
universarum .

ut mittat in ea chrisma. D. and Claud. add dicens, In nornine, etc. :
Ramsey dicens, Sanctificetur oque zita, etc. The addition of chrism is
not mentioned in Egb. ln Claud, Lan, and D. the rubric proceeds ,
with the direction that mortar is to he prepared with the holy water, to
be used in enclosing the relics: D. seems, like Rob. at a later point, to
contemplate the possibility of there being no enclosure ol relies.

Cantando antiphonam asperges me. Lan. and 146 also seem to
prescribe the use of the anthem without the psalm Miserere at the signing
of the altar, the anthem being repeated and followed by the psalm
during the circuits of the altar which follow. Egb., [)., and 146 prescribe
the use of the anthem and psalm during both stages; 44 prescribes
the anthem and psalm at the signing, repeating the anthem only for the
circuits. Ramsey directs the use of consecratory words (Sanctificetur
troc ottare, etc.) at the signing, and of the anthem and psalm at the
circuits.

Pateant adhoc altare. Claud. omits this collect : Egb. substitutes
for it the long benediction of the altar (Domine sancte pater clemens)
which appears later in Rob.: 44 has a form (also beginning Pateont od
troc altare) different from that in the majority of the Pontificals.

circumeat intus ecclesiam. All the MSS. agree in directing the
sprinkling of the interior and exterior of the church, and all provide
anthems to be sung during or after the circuits made for this purpose.

But there is a certain amount of divergence in detail. (i.) While most
of the books direct that the external sprinkling is to be performed by
the bishop, attended by all the clergy, Claud. directe, and D. permitS,
that he is to send some of the clergy out of the church to discharge this
function, himself remaining within. (ii.) While most of the books
direct a threefold sprinkling of the exterior as well as of the interior,
Claud. and D. indicate that the outside is to be sprinkled onlyonce. F or
this D. assigns a reason-that while the three internal circuits signify
, the faith in the Holy Trinity, the one external circuit signifies the one
baptism qnod gerit extrinsecus ecclesio. (iii.) While some of the books
seem to contemplate the use of the anthems and collects at the close of
each circuit, others seem to direct the singing of the anthems during the
circuits, a collect following at the completion of the circuit in each
case: Egb. and Claud. provide no collecte: in Lan. the arrangement
of the collects and also of the anthems is rather confused. (iv.) There
