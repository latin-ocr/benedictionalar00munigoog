as a pontificae There is a distinction between the two parts,
sofar as the decoration is concerned: the ornamental borders
and full-page miniatures are confined to the ‚Benedictional
proper: and at the end of this part, and at the beginning of the
Pontifical portion, some leaves seem to have been left blank, as
though it might have been intended to bind the two portions
separately. The like division by blank leaves, however, seems
to have been made between the two sections of the Bene-
dictional portion: and it is to be noted that a particular form,
which occurs in the second portion of the book, and is there
written at full length, is indicated only by its first words when
its use is contemplated in the first portion. If the Benedic-
tional proper had been intended to be made a separate volume,
it is most likely that it would have contained this form in full.²

There seems to beno reason to doubt the correctness os
Professor Westwood’s j udgement that the MS. was written
during the latter part of the tenth century in the N ew‘Minster
of Winchester. Its handwriting and illumination seem to
approach more nearly to those ¹of the Benedictional of S.
¹AEthelwold than to the rather later work of the Missal of Robert
of Jumieges ; and the place of writing may be determined with
sufficient certainty from the character of the writing and orna-

mentation‚ and also from the appearance in the text of the
Benedictional proper of forms for the festivals of S. Judoc and
S. Grimbald, who were specially venerated at the New Minster,
and the presence of the names of the same saints in the litanies
contained in the Pontifical portion of the volume.8 The theory,

¹ There is some inconveniente in employing, to describe the whole book, a term
which has to be often employed, in a somewhat different sense, to denote a partos
its contents; and the use of the word “ Benedictional'' seems to suggesta book of
like character with the Benedictional of S. AEtbelwold. Thus Maskell, distinguishing
between the Benedictionale and Pontificale, mentions as examples of the former the
Benedictionals of S. AEthelwold and Abp. Robert, adding that the Benedictionalc is
sometimes included in the Pontificale (Mora Rit. Eccl. Angl.‚ 1882, vol. i. p. cxlvi).
But the wider use of the term “ Benedictionale '' isancient. It was applied to denote
books containing offices for the blessing of persons and things, even though such
books did not contain a Benedictionale in the more special sense of the term. Thus a
Canterbury inventory of 1312 includes a “benedictionale pro pueris confirmandis et
vestimentis benedicendis '‘ anda “benedictionale ro consecratione altaris et cimiterii ’'
(Inventam cg Christchurch, Cantaerbum ed. by J. Wickham Legg and W. H.
St. J. Hope, vo, Westminster, 1902, p. 75). ln the particular case of the “ Bene·
dictionale ’' of Archbishop Robert, the employment of the term is established by long
use, and it seems best to retain it.

² The form is one for the Benediction of Ashes, which appears (by its cue) in the
Benedr'ctrimal for use on Ash Wednesday‚ and (in full) in the Pontifical for use at the
Dedication of a Church. Its use for this purpose might possibly be more frequent
than the annual use on Ash Wednesday.

³ Both names appear in the longer of the two litanies at the Dedication of a
Church 3 that of S. Judoc appears also in the shorter. , b
