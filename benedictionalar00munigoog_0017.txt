framea. xiii

some special distinction should be given by the scribe to the
name of S. Denis.

The name of S. Bartholomew seems to have been written
later than those with which it is associated in the litany; and
this may suggest that the introduction of the name of the
Apostle, or the prominence given to it, may be due to some
special circumstances connected with a place where the book
was in use at a date somewhat later than that of the original
scribe It is indeed probable that before the alleged translation
of the saint's remains from Benevento to Rome reporta of
miracles wrought by his intercession had become more notable
or more widely spread: even if the translation did not actually
take place before the end of the tenth century‚¹ the same causes
which induced one or more of the Emperors to seek to bring
it about may have had some effect even in England upon the
cultus of the Apostle. The benediction for his festival in the
book under consideration, and also in the Pontifical of S.
Dunstan, makes express mention of the number of his miracles,
whereas in the Benedictional of S. AEthelwold and in pontificale
Lanaletense the form provided is less specially significant The
appearance of S. Bartholomew’s name among those of the
patron saints of Croyland seems to date from the time of
the restoration of the abbey, and is probably to be connected
with the relic of the Apostle said to have been bequeathed to
Croyland by Turketul, the first abbot of the restored monastery,
having been acquired bthm as a gift from Henry “the Fowler,”
to whom it had been given by a Duke of Benevento If we
accept the statements on the subject contained in the Chronicle
of Ingulf, it would appear that before the middle of the tenth
century a notable relic of the saint had found its way to
England.² The dedication-title of the parish church at Hyde
seems at first sight to suggest the possibility of an early
veneration of the Apostle in a place specially connected with
the New Minster ; but the date of the dedication is uncertain:
and the close relation of the New Minster with the place to
which it was afterwards removed is probably of a date later

¹ The question of the date, and even of the ¹fact, of the translation is somewhat
doubtful. According to the tale which attributes the translation to the Emperor
Otto ΙΙ., it would apparently have taken place in 983. lf the better-supported
statement, which attributes it to Otto III., be true, the event rnnst have occurred
between 983 and 1002.

² The authority of “ Ingulf’' is not generally a secure foundation; but in such
a matter as this, in which the writer would be likely to follow the tradition handed
down at Croyland, it may be worth something. Turketul’s former position in the
kingdom is perhaps not exactly described by ⁸⁸ Iugulf ;” but from Ordericus vitalis
it would appear that he was a person not at all unlikely to have been brought into
persona] intercourse with Henry during the negotiations for the marriage of Otto.
