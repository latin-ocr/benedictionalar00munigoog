XX PREFACE.

in spite of its late date it presents so much resemblance to the
earlier books as to make it worth while to take some account
of it in connection with them.

All the Pontifical offices contained in the “Benedictional '' of
Archbishop Robert are to be found also in other books of the
series On the other hand, it differs from the majority of the
other books of the group by way of omission. lts contents
include no forms relating to the trial by Ordeal. In this
respect, however, it agrees with the “Pontifical of Egbert.”
The absence of such forms does not, of course, indicate that they
were not employed by the possessors of the books which omit
them: they were most probably provided in another volume.

Itis perhaps unnecessary to say that the limitation of the
comparisons attempted in the notes to a small number of
English Pontificals does not imply that these books ought to
be regarded as standing by themselves, apart from books of
the same class which had their origin and their use elsewhere
than in England. It is hardly to be supposed that either the
formation or the development of the English Pontificals was
independent of extemal infiuence: the importance of the group
in which the Pontifical of Archbishop Robert has its place is
not greater than that which would belong to any compact group
of similar books of equally early date proceeding from any
other region equally well defined. Some limitation in the
range of comparison, however, was necessary; and it appeared
to be on the whole best to confine the comparison, as a rule, to
those books which, in point of time and place, stood nearest
to the text, and thus to show how far the text itself might be
regapded as representative of the region and the period to which
it be ongs.

With regard to the collection os Episcopal benedictions
which forms the first part of the contents of the volume, it may
be said that it presents few points of special interest. Except
for the benedictions for the festivals of the saints specially
venerated in the New Minster, S. Grimbald and S. Judoc, and
for a series of ferial benedictions which have for their theme the
account of the Days of the Creation in the first chapter of
Genesis, there is little in either division of the series which is
at all unusual. The greater part of the benedictions which
make up the whole series, and almost the whole of those which
make up the division containing benedictions per anni circulum,
are to be found not only in the MSS. with which, so far as its
Pontifical offices are concerned, Archbishop Robert's book
is most closely in agreement, but also in the “Pontifical

of Egbert” and the Benedictional of St AEthelwold. The
