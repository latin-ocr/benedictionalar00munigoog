Pirama. xxi

collection which forms the basis of this series had an influence
on the benedictions of the English Pontificals which may be
traced in later books as well as in those of the earliest group.
But it was by no means limited to England: the comparison

of even a small number of authorities will suffice to show that
its use was widely extended.

In the editing of the text use was made, in the first place, of
a transcript given to the Society by the late Mr. S. S. Lewis,
for whom it had been made at Rouen under the direction of
the late Abbe Sauvage. From this transcript, after revision,
the text was printed, and the sheets were carefully collated
with the MS. at Roucn by Mr. L. G. Wickham Legg. The
spelling of the MS. has been followed throughout3 and the
punctuation of the MS. has also been followed, with certain
exceptions. The stop most frequently used by the original
scribe is the simple point (.); but it is used with a difference in ·
value corresponding to its position in relation to the line. It
seemed impracticable to reproduce these distinctions accurately
in printing; and they have therefore been disregarded, the
point being placed in all cases at the usual level In the lists
of capitula the scribe's usage with regard to the omission or
insertion of a point at the end of each heading, and before and
after numerals, is irregular. ln the text, he frequently omits
the point at the end of a sentence. In the printed text numerals
are in all cases followed, but not preceded, by a point; and the
point has been added at the end of headings and sentences
where the scribe had omitted it. The later additions to the
original contents of the MS. are distinguished by being printed
in smaller ty e.

Where muliical notation occurs in the MS. the fact is indi-
cated by the use of asterisks placed at the beginning and end
of the words noted.

The two lithographic plates representing the miniatures and
decorative work of the MS. are from drawings made for the late
Mr. S. S. Lewis: for these the Society is indebted to the kind·
ness of Mrs. Lewis The collotype plates illustrating the hand-
writing of particular pages were made from photographs taken
for the Society at Rouen.

In conclusion, I must express my thanks not only to the
Chairman of the Council and to the Treasurer of the Society
for such help as they never fail to give to those who are
engaged in its work, but to others who have in various ways
rendered me useful assistance. In particular, 1 would desire to
acknowledge the aid which 1 have received from the transcripts ¹
