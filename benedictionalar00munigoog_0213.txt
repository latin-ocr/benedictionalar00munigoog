combining two sets, of which one is represented by Pamelius‘ Utrecht set
(cited in the following notes as Pam. 2), the other by the benedictiones
quotidianae ol 0., ΚοΙΙ., and Pam. It is probable that the set oi Pam. 2
was meant to be repeated on the remaining Sundays before Advent‚
and the other set, though described as quotidianae, were possibly
employed as a series for the Sundays from Pentecost to Advent‚ either
by applying the same benediction tor two consecutive Sundays, or by
beginning the series 'alresh when its end was reached. There is, ol
course, the usual variation in the description of the Sundays as post
Pentecosten or ,tort Octavas Pentecosten among the different texts which
follow on the whole the sante order as Rob.; but it does not seem
necessary to take notice ol this in detail.
