their hands with a linen napkin (p. 70).¹ The use of flowers for decking
churches seems to be implied (p. 71). With regard to Baptism, Easter
is regarded as the normal time for its administration ; in the case of
those who were baptized at any other festival, a preparation of seven
days is enjoined, in which the candidates were admitted “ad oleum vel
ad manus impositionem '’ (p. 71) ; that is to say, they were admitted (as
those to be baptized at Easter were admitted during Lent) to the status
of catechumens, and to the preparation for Baptism, on some day before
that on which they were baptized. It is, perhaps, hardly likely that the
ancient order of the preparation for Ba ttsm was so generally observed
in England at the date to. which the 118. belongs, as this passage would
seem to imply3 but it is not improbable that its observance was
regarded as a thing desirable, and one which might properly be recom-
mended, although it was no longer enforced. How long the primitive
custom of delivering the Eucharist into the hands of lay communicants
was retained in England is uncertain. ln France it was prohibited by
a canon sometimes cited as an enactment ol a Council of Tours, some-
times as that of a Council of Rouen, which Martene (De Ant. Eccl. nit,
lib. Ι. cap. iv.) refers to Rouen and assigns to the ninth century, while
Sala, in his notes on Bona (De Reb. Liturg, lib. ΙΙ. cap. xvii), also
referring it to Rouen, assigns it to a date about 650, on the authority of
a recent edition (1717) of the Councils of the Province of Rouen. ln
England it certainly existed at the time of Caedmon's death, c. 680 (see
Bede, Hist. Eccl, iv. 24), and may have continued much later. The §th
of Mabillon’s Ordines Romani speaks of priests receiving in their hands,
as though the rule for others than priests was different3 the sixth
provides (as may be seen on pp. 64, 65 of this volume) that the priests
aqui depicons assisting at Mass should receive in their hands, but not
t esub eacons.

Other customs mentioned in the sermon, which are probably of a
heathen or semi-heathen kind, relating to the veneration of trees and
wells, and to the consultation of soothsayers and sorcerers (p. 71), were
probably by no means extinctio England in the tenth century, and are
not altogether unknown in the twentieth.

pp. 73, sqq. The order here provided for the consecration of a church is
somewhat more developed than that in Egbert's Pontifical. It agrees
very closely with the parallel part of the other English Pontificals of the
tenth and eleventh centuries, most closely with Pontificale Lanaleteme,
the Pontifical of S. Dunstan, and MS. 146 of tbe Library of Corpus
Christi College, Cambridge, which, as regards the earlier portion of its
contents‚ seems to have proceeded from Winchester. The British
Museum MS. Claudius A. iii. is in some details nearer to Egbert than
this group3 the British Museum MS. Add. 28,188 (a paremly from
Ramsey), and MS. 44 of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (apparently
from Canterbury), often agree together, and both show a slightly more
advanced development than the group to which our text belongs. These
