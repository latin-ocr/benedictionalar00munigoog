before the introduction of the relies. For this Ramsey and 44 provide
alternative forms, to be used according to the particular dedication-
title of the church. In 146 there is a single form with variable clauses
at the beginning; and the same method is followed in D. and Lan,
which provide a form of commendation after the enclosing of the relies.
Egb. and Claud. have no commendation. · ⁶ . ·

in Lan. has some forms which do not appear in the senes tn Rob.,
including in its collection some forms which in Rob. aud D. are the
subjects of separate sections-the forms for bleesing a bell, for conse-
crating a cross, a font, and a cemetery. Most of the forms contained
in Rob. are found also in Egb. and Claud, though not as a continuous
series, and with more variation of text than in Lan. and D. Egb.,
Claud, Lan, D. all include in their series the two benedictione which
appear in Rob. as a preliminary to the vesting of the altar (p. 89).

p. 93. Deua qni poet typicum. This is preceded in Lan. by another
prayer which is absent from D. and Rob.

p. 96. Post haee extra eeclesiam, etc. ln this section, dealing with the
introductiones the relics not as a part of the dedication but as an act
subsequent to the preliminary dedication, and preceding the dedication
mass, Rob., 146, 44, and Ramsey are in general agreement. ln 146
and 44 the form of the rubric shows that the dedication is regarded as
completed before this section begins (Finita dedicatione ecclesiae induat
se epsicopus, etc, 146; Finita autem dedicatione ecclesiae egrediatur

pontefex, etc, 44). All four prescribe a change of vestments at this
point.
