Χ PREFACE.

1821.¹ In 1832 Mr. John Gage² appended a careful account of
the book and its contents to his edition of the Benedictional
of S. AEthelwold.³ More recently it hasbeen described by
M. Silvestre in his Pallographie Universelle, by M. Pottier in
Frere’s Manuel du Bibliograplze Narmand, and by the late
Professor Westwood in his Facsimiles of Miniatures and Orna-
ments in Angla-Saron and Irislr Manuscrr'pts. Bries notices os
it may be sound in the list of English Pontificals prefixed by
the Dean of Carlisle to his edition os the Pontifical of Cardinal
Bainbridge4 in the more detailed list included by Mr. W. H.
Frere in the third volume of the Alcuin cluo Collatinus, and in
M. Henri Omont’s Catalogue ol the MSS. of the Rouen
Library.

The volume, which now⁵ bears the press-mark Y 7, is in a
modern binding ol yellow leather, and contains 191 numbered
leaves, measuring approximately 12} by 9³} inches.⁶ So far as its
original contents are concerned‚ the manuscript is a fine speci-
men of English writing and illumination: the miniatures which
remain are only three in number; but in each case the page
facing the miniature is decorated with a border in gold and
’ colour; and similar borders appear in two other places where
there is now no miniature. In one of these places (between
sol. 8 and iol. 9) there is an apparent break in the text; and
here at any rate it seems likely that a leaf has been removed:
in the other case (between sol. 27 and fol. 28) it does not
appear that any part of the text has been lost.

The book is commonly called a “Benedictional’' but it
contains not only a Benedictional in the narrower sense of the
word—a collection ol Episcopal benedictions sor use in the
service of the Mass, such as we find as a separate volume in
the Benedictional of S. AEthelwold, or as a partos most of the
English Pontificals—but also a collection os Pontifical offices.
It might, in lact, be described with equal or greater accuracy

⁶ Its former prem-mark was Y 373 Mr. Gage gives it the number 27. In the
numeration of M. Omont’s Catalogue it is No. 369. ‚

οΜ. Omont gives the size in millimetres as 322x2323 Mr. W. H. Frere‚ as
325x226. Both these measurements differ slightly from that supplied to me by
Mr. L. G. Wickham Legg (324x233). He remarks that the book is so tightly
bound as to make it a difficult matter accurately to distinguish the gatherings at the
beginning and end of the volume. To this condition may perhaps be ascribed the
slight variation in the different measuremeuts, and the fact that Mr. Wickham Legg’s
details as to the gatherings do not exactly agree with Mr. Frere’s. Mr. Frere's
statement seems to take no account of the loss of a leaf between sol. 8 and fol. 9.
