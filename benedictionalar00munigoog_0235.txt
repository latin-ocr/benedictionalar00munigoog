meant for use at the close of the council, as appears from its contents.
Both parts are found in English books, and also in books ol F rench
origin ; and the same may be said of the benediction which follows them.

pp. 153-157. The Order for a Provincia] Council was printed by Mabillon
in his Vetera Analecta, vol. ii. (Paris, 1676), from a copy furnished by
Pelehester‚ the Librarian of the Church of Rouen. Mabillon notes the ,
fact that the Order is a later addition to the original contents of the
MS. ; buthe had probably not seen the book itself, and formed his idea
of the date of this part of its contents from the evidence which he
collected from its text. He supposed it to be of the time of Archbishop
Guillaume Bonne-Ame (1079-1110), on the following grounds :-

(1) That it is of a date later than the death of S. Maurilius (1067),
who is referred to as venerabilis memoriae (p. 155, line 16).

(2) That it seems to regard some of those present in the council as
having assisted at a former council of the province, held in the time of
Maurilius, when the definition against Berengarius was made. This
he supposes to have been in 1063.

(3) That it contains (p. 157, line 19) a reference to an enactmeut
made in the time of the father of the reigning prince‚ pro coercenda
praeceptum cupuditate, which he connects with the decrees of a council
held at Lillebonne in 1080.

The last of these reasons seems to be unsound. The whole passage
in which the clause on which it is based occurs is taken from the Eighth
Council of Toledo, with little variation beyond the omission of the
name of the princeos,- and the allusions to particular enactments,
whether in favour of the title of the father of the princeps to dominions

history of Normandy or of the province of Rouen. The first reason
seems sufficient to fix the date of the composition of the document after
1067 3 but the phrase referred to as implying that bishops present had
also been present at the council held by S. Maurilius may not imply
more than such corporate identity as a later provincial council may
have with an earlier one.

lt is, of course, possible that the document, though apparently written
towards the end of the 12th century, is copied from an order drawn up
while some members of Maurilius’ Council were still bishops of the
province; but in that case the phrase, if Mabillon's interpretation of it
be adopted, must be regarded as a survival.

p. 154. De coneilio calcedonensi. heram xviiii. The word hera or aera
is used here, and also a few lines later, in the sense of capitulum.

p. 155. Corde oredimus et ore profitemur. panem, etc. This definition
appears again in the examination of the bishop-elect (p. 164).

p. 156. Item de contemptoribus oanonum in toletano oonollio vii.
Mabillon observes that what follows is not found in the decrees of the
Seventh Council of Toledo, The clause Si quis . . . multetur seems
like a condensation and combinatiou of two passages, one in the decrees
of the sixth, the other in those of the eighth council :-

“Quodsi in quidpiam horum quisquam nostrorum temerario ausu
