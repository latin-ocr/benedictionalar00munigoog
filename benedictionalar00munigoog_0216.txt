Then follows (with the heading Item alia absolutio) the prayer Deus
innocentiae restitutor (p. 60), and after it an Absolutio episcopi, which
is not in D. or Rob.; D. substitutos for the Absolutio episcopi another
rayer, and adds directions for the admonition of the penitent.

pp. 1-65. The Ordo contained in these pages is, as has been said above
’ (p. 60, note), an addition to the original contents of the Ms, made at a
date at which it would appear that the book was at Rouen, since other
additions of the same period belong to that locality. The Ordo is to be
found also in Hittorp’s Ordo Rornanns, and Mabillon states that he had
collated several MSS. for the text which he includes in his series of
Ordines Romani. Of these it is most likely that our MS. was one,
since Mabillon appears to have made use of it for other purposes.
pp. 66, 67. The fragment of the Canon, like the Ordo which precedes it, was
most probably written at Rouen. The most notable feature of its text
is the mention of S. Hippolytus among the saints commemorated in
the communicantes. No other unusual name appears either in this or
in the later clauses which contain the names of saints, and the insertion
does not warrant any precise inference as to the source of the text copied
by the'scribe. ln the Rouen MS. A. 566, which probably came from
S. Denis, the name of S. Hippolytus is only one of a large number of
unusual names inserted in the Communicantes. (See Delisle, Mino.
sur d'onc. Sacramentaires, p. 294.)
pp. 69-72. The use of the smaller type employed for the later additions to
the original MS. in these pages is the result of the manner in which the
sermon had been copied by the transcriber. Though the sermon is
perhaps an addition to the original contents of the book, it appears to
be actually the work of the original scribe, and may therefore be
regarded as having been intended for use in England. It seems, how-
ever, most probable that Martene’s suggestion as to the original author-
ship of the sermon is right, and that (apart from some interpolations)
it is really the work of S. Caesarius of Arles.1 Thus its references to
liturgical usages are primarily evidence for the customs observed in
south-eastem Gaul in the first half of the sixth century, not for those
observed in England in the last years of the tenth or the first years of
the eleventh. But it may be reasonable, perhaps, to suppose that the
customs mentioned in the sermon were not wholly unknown to those
for whose edification it was copied: had they been so, the force of the
illustrations drawn from them would have been slight, and injunctions
to observe them would hardly have been delivered. The usages in
question are not very numerous. Reference is made to the cleansing
of the hands of those who drew near the altar to communicate, and to
the practice that women coming to receive the Sacrameut should cover

¹ Dom Germain Morin, who speaks with special authority on such a question,
informs me that he is strongly of this opinion ε he has kindly pointed out to me that
the sermon appears with some variation of readings, and with the omission of the
last 18 lines on p. 72, in the 8th century montianum of Burchard,a collection for the
most part made up of discourses of S. Caesarius. See his article on the Homilsitrium
in Reouc Binidictine, vol. xiii. p. 105 (March, 1896).
