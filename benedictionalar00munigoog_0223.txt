NOTES. 183

Vidi ciuitatem). Ramsey has it, and adds a third anthem (Sub altare
domem), which is also in Egb., Claud, D.‚ Lan.

Recondat aas super ipsum altare. Ramsey also says super altam
146 has in ecclesiam 44, in loco opto. The altar, according to these
books, has been already vested, and the method of enclosing the relics
in the altar therefore seems inapplicable.

Deus quiex omni coaptione. This in Egb., Claud, D.. Lan,
is the prayer which follows the enclosing of the relics. ln Ramsey
it is followed, rather oddly, by the Denuntz’atzir antequam reliquiae
ponantur, with various anthems and prayers for the enclosing. These
may have been intended for use in cases where the usage of enclosing
was followed. After the collect Deus qui ex omni, Egb., Claud, D.,
Lan. direct the vesting of the altar, with the anthem Ornoverunt and
the collect Descendot (pp. 89, 90, above). Lan. adds some further
prayers with the anthem Confirmat (p. 90, above). Then follows in D.
and Lan. the commendation of the church.

p. 97. Ab oriente. This anthem appears in Lan. (without mention of the
lights) before the collect Deus qui exomni.

Missa ordine congruo celebratur. The mass which follows agrees
for the most part with Egb., Claud, D., and Lan. The Gospel is that
of an alternative massin D. Egb. and Lan. have Non estem'm orbor
. . . superponam. D. has not the first collect. The first benediction
is in D. as that of a massa speciales oedz‘sicontrh ecclen'am; the second
is in Egb. and Lan. and also (as an alternative form) in D.

p. 100. Missa pro aedificante ecelesiam. The collect, secret, and post-
communion are all included in the parallel mass in D. and Lan, which
have as a second collect Deus qui loca. -

Per vii. dies in eadem, etc. Lan. has a similar rubric; thatin D.
is in almost exact agreement with Rob. D. adds a series of anthems‚
psalms, and nine lessons for mattins,and anthems and psalms for lauds.
This is also the case in Lan.

pp. 101-103. The Order for the consecration of a cemetery is practically
identical with that in the Pontificals of Egbert and of S. Dunstan, in
MS. Claud. A. iii, and in Pontistcole Lonolefense. There is no
mention of the nse of the litany before the prayers, which these books
direct. The same prayers appear also in the Pontifical of S. Thomas
of Canterbnry (Douai Library, MS. 67), and in the two Pontificals
already cited as 146 and 44. ln these last three, however, there is a

. certain amount of further development. ln the Douai MS. this only
amounts to the direction of a preliminary exorcismus oquae, and a
{tettanltl'ttlttzttallt Mittunt·..illatrant
the last of the five prayers. ln 44, after the litany and exorcismus
aquae‚twelve candles are to be lighted at the four corners of the ground;
and the circuit of the ground is to be made three times before the first
litte {intitulatimittit{tta{filttrtttttltll
by the bishop with uplifted hand.

ln Pontfficole Lonoletense there is no indication of the parts of the
ground at which the five prayers are to be said ; and in this point there
is a slight variation among the other books mentioned. Egb., Claud,
and 146 direct the first prayer to be towards the east, the second
towards the south, the third towards the west, and the fourth towards
the north, thus making a circuit of the ground. The others, like Rob.,

Ἰ make the second prayer towards the west, the third towards the south,
so that in the course cf the prayers the sign of the cross is, as it were,
traced upon the ground. But this is not assigned as a reason for the
