Pirama. xix

of S. Dunstan,”1 and the book of Archbishop Robert, show
a large amount of agreement: this is perhaps most marked in
the case of the last two. But the agreement between them
does not extend to the whole of their contents: they have
apparently drawn their material in some cases from different
sources. The second (in point of date) of the fragments con·
tained in MS. Claudius A. iii. seems to stand near to these: in
one case where S. Dunstan's book differs from that of Arch-
bishop Robert, it agrees with the latter. The handwriting of
this fragment appears to be rather later than that of Archbishop
Robert's book. A litany which forms part of its contents
includes the names of several saints specially venerated at
Canterbury. Of these the name of S. Alphege is written in
capitals while that of S. Dunstan is marked for repetition.

The original portion of the contents of the Pontifical known
as that of Bishop Sampson of Worcester (Corpus Christi college,
Cambridge, MS. 146) proceeds apparently from Winchester,
and probably from the Old Minster. As might be expected,
it shows a good deal of agreement with Archbishop Robert's
book, but in some cases it agrees with that of S. Dunstan. It
is of a later date than the MSS. of the last-mentioned group,
and shows some additions and a slight development of cere-
monial. In the section relating to Ordinations, it stands rather
apart from the older books. The eleventh century Canterbury
Pontifical in the same Library (MS. 44) shows a somewhat
wider divergence from the earlier MSS. than the Winchester
Pontifical: most of its offices appear to have undergone a certain
amount of revision and expansion either by way of additional
details or by the lengthening of the prayers?

Nearer in some respects to the earlier MSS. than either of
these tw0, and therefore probably representative, like Egbert‘s
Pontifical, of a MS. a good deal earlier than the date at which
it was itself written, is the Pontifical associated with the name
of S. Thomas of Canterbury, now in the Public Library of
Douai. The MS. itself is assigned to the twelfth century 3⁸ but

¹ MS. Lat. 943 of the Bibliotheqne Nationale, Paris. Itis assigned to the latter
pazt Sbffddfelfbld deelfdilrsyin the Consecratr'o Regis contained in this MS. seem to point
to the accession of Edward the Confessor as the trme when this part of its contenis
was revised. The British Museum MS. Add. 28,188‚ which Mr. Frere believes to
bave been written for Herbert de Losinga, Abbot of Ramsey, and Bishop (1091-
1119) of Thetford and Norwich‚ agrees with the Canterbury book in the details of 1ts
oCrder for the Consecration of a Church; but its date falls, apparently, after the

on uest.

³(Some parts of the contenis of the MS, as well as the tradition conceming its
ownership, may point to Canterbury as the place for which the book was written 3 but
the names of saints which appear in the longer litany of its order for the Consecration
of a Church seem to suggest that the scribe followed, at least in part of his work, a
MS. written at Winchester or intended for use by a Bishop of that see.
