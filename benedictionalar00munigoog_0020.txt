xvi PREFACE.

Robert’s consecration coincides with that of the death of
AEthelgar3 and the hypothesis that AEthelgar’s Pontifical may
have been obtained by Emma on his decease, as a possession
for her brother, is rather a tempting one. On the other hand,
it may perhaps weigh against the identification of “Archbishop
Robert'' with Robert of Rouen, that none of those additions to
the original contents of the book which were evidently made
after its transference to Normandy appears to be of a date
earlier than 1050, and that there is, as we have seen, some
ground for supposing that the book was still at Canterbury at
a time at least thirty years after the death of AEthelgar, when
the ltlrng pontificate of Robert of Rouen was more than half
comp eted.

On the whole, it may be said that while the evidence of the
Rouen list, and the fact that the book was for centuries the
property of the Cathedral Church of Rouen, seem to be in
favour of Dom Tassin’s view, the question of ownership can
hardly be decided with certainty. If the evidence does not
warrant a decision in favour of Robert of Normandy, it certainly
does not warrant a decision in favour of Robert of Jumieges;
and it would seem that some of those who have followed the
lead of Abbe‘ Saas have been influenced by the tendency to
associate the “Benedictional” with the Sacramentary given to
Jumieges by the English Archbishop, and by the belief that it,

as well as the Sacramentary, formed part of the Jumibges
collection of MSS.l

So much as this, however, is clear—that the “Benedictional,”

written at first for use in England passed into Normandy, ·

probably before the middle ol the eleventh century, and has
since remained there. The additions made from time to time
to the original contents of the volume are concerned, for the
most part, with matters for which· it at first contained no
provision. In some cases their Norman character is clearly
marked: thus the order for a Provincial Council is clearly for
the province of Rouen: the additional section relating to the
Ordination of Bishops provides for the profession of obedience
to the see of Rouen: the order “ad ducem constituendum,”
though it contains no mention of the particular duchy, was

cites as a Rouen MS.) but the kindred Pontifical (now also in the Public Library at
Rouen) known as pontificale Lunaletense.
