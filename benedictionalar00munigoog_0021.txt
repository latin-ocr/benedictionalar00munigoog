apparently written ata later date than these sections, and there·
fore must also belong to Normandy. To Normandy also may
be assigned the writing ol the matter on the preliminary leaves,l
consisting of extracts from various patristic authors, and ol the
declaration os belief concerning the Eucharist which, in the
order for the Provincial Council, is attributed to the Council
of the Province oi Rouen held in 1063, under the presidency os
S. Maurilius.

The order for “constituting'' the Duke has apparently been
constructed from the material furnished by the “Consecratio
Regis,” which forms part of the original contents oi the
Pontifical. Some portions os this order have been omitted,
others have been altered, to suit the conditions oi the case for
which the new order was intended to serve. The additional
section relating to the consecration of Bishops provides for the
detailed examination of the Bishopelect, and ior some modifica-
tions of the order contained in the older part oi the book. But
the changes are not of any very great importance. It may be
supposed that, with the exception oi the ⁸⁴ consecratio Regis,”
for the use of which there would be no occasion in the dukedom
of Normandy, the Pontifical offices of the original MS. continued
to be used in N ormandy just as they stood, or with alterations
of the slightest character.

It is not at all surprising that this should be the case. lf
the account generally given of the “ Pontifical ol Egbert,’' which
represents it as a tenth-century copy oi an earlier English
Pontifical, be correct, the same thing had probably occurred at
an earlier date; and the case of another manuscript already

. mentioned, the Pontificale Lanaletense, furnishes another parallel.

It has been doubted whether this book was actually written in
England or in France; it certainly seems to have been in use
in Brittany; and, if written there, its contents were probably
copied for the most part from an English book nearly con-
temporary with the “Benedictional '’ ol Archbishop Robert,
with which, in most of the offices, as well as in its collection os
Episcopal benedictione, it is generally in close agreement The
most notable departure from this agreement is in the order ior
the Coronation oi a King. In the “Benedictional,'’ as in the
majority of the English Pontificals anterior to the Norman

Conquest, the order is that which is commonly associated with

the name oi Ethelred, and which was probably introduced in the
time of S. Dunstan.2 The “Pontifical oi Egbert'' and pontificale

¹ The contents oi these leaveS, not strictly forming part oi the Pontifical, have not
been included in this volume.

² Mr. E. W. Robertson (Historical Essays, 1872) seems inclined to adopt Waltz’s
suggestion, and to connect the adoption of this new order with the coronation oi
