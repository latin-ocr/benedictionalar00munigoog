PREFACE.

THE manuscript known as Baadictebnarius Roberti Arciapiscapi,
formerly in the Cathedral Library os Rouen‚ and now in the
Public Library os the same city, has been frequently described
with more or less fulness oi detail, and some parts oi its contents
have been more than once printed. The learned F rench Oratoriau
Jean Morin made considerable extracts from it in his great
works‚ De Disciplina in Administratcbae SacramentiPaem'tentiae1
and De Sacris Ecclesiae Ordinationes? He was inclined to
attach to its evidence an importance greater than that which
it may properly claim, since, in common with some other
scholars ol his own day, he assigned to the book a date much
earlier than that at which the earliest portion ol' its contents
seems to have really been written.³ Martene, whose estimate
of the date ol the book practically agrees with that os Morin,
made much uscos the text sor his work, De Antiqais Ecclesiae
liitibas.4 Mabillon also published in his Vetera Analecta some
os the later parts os the contents os the volume :⁵ he, too, seems
to have been'somewhat at fault in deciding the date of the
portions which he printed.

In 1746 the Abbe Saas, in his account of the manuscripts ol
the Library of Rouen Cathedral, devoted some pages to the
book, and in 1747 certain questions as to its history were
rather warmly debated between him and his critic, Dom Tassin.⁶

The volume was also the subject of notices by the Abbe Gour-
din in 1812‚⁷ and by the English bibliophile T. F. Dibdin in

¹ Fol. Paris, 1651. ² Fol. Paris, 1655.
³ He supposed it to be os the eighth century.
