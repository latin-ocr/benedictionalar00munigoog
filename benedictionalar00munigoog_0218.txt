with this rubric, to which Egb. joins the direction for placing lighted
candles round the church; 44 begins with the first portion of the rubric,
but makes a break at debent, inserting directions for the use, after
vesting‚ of the psalm Deus misereatur, certain preces and a collect
(Deus quinarem), and then proceeding Deinde veniunt, etc. Ramsey
begins with the forms to be used after vesting3 146 with the direction
to say, after vesting‚ the collect Dens quipaterno.

zachaee festinans descende. Egb. places before this anthem, and
after the setting of the candles, the collect Actiones nostras,· after the
anthem it roceeds at once with the litany. Claud. omits anthem,
collecte, ang litany.

( Omnipotens et. misericors deus, qui sacerdotibus).

nt illuminentur, etc. This action in Egb. takes place earlier. ln
D. it is accompanied by an anthem (Ab orr'ente portae tres, eto), and
followedby a collect (Deus qui apostolorum).

Et ter eirotumeet, etc. ln Egb. and Claud. no precise number of
circuits is prescribed3 D. orders that the procession is to start from
the S. door, by which the entrance into the church is afterwards

omits the former direction, but orders the fixing of the cross ¹with the
same variation of the anthem. ln the text, with which Lan. and 146
agree, the midst of the church is not reached till some point in the
course of the psalm Fundamenta eins, and there is no instruction as to
what the bishop is to do with the cross he carries in his hand. Egb.
omits Fundamenta eius, and places the anthem Benedic domim (in
a different form) after the collect Dens qni invisibiliter.

here the psalm Benedixrhti domine, with anthem Domine qui Moysi
locutus es, followed by a long collect (Dens qni Moysi famulo tno ex

(eminentiorem), which appears also (in a later hand) in Lan.
