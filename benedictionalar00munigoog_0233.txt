NOTES. 193

sacramentarios, and of Missale Francorum· but there is a difference

between the three books. Messala Francorum omits a passage which is

common to the Leonine and Gelasian texts: the Leonine, on the other
hand, omits the last part of the form as it appears in the Gelasian and
in Mi'ssale Francorum. In the supplementary part of the Gregorian

Sacramentaries the Benedictio Vi‘rgtnum includes what may be called

a short recension of it, beginning in the same way, and containing the

part which is omitted in Mi'ssale Francorum, combined with a different

endin from that in any of the other early texts. The English Ponti-

ficalsirave both the shorter and the longer recension ; the longer in the
form in which it appears in Mi'ssale Francorum. In Egb. the two are
consecutive, the shorter form following the other. In the later books,
the longer form alone is retained in the Benedictio Virginem, the other
being appropriated, with slight alteration (eg. the substitution of rexa-
gesimi' fructus for centesimi fructus, and of uiduarum for virginum) to
the Benediction of Widows (see p. 139).

Before Deus castorum corporum, Egb. and the four books which are
in agreement with Rob. throughout this section insert the prayer T e
invocamus, which is found in the Gelasian Sacramentary, and which in
these books seems to serve as a sort of introduction to the principal
benediction. In Claud.2 and 44, Te invocamus is placed just before
Benedicat te conditor, which in these two MSS. immediately precedes
the giving of the veil, and sofar occupies the same place which Rob.
and its group assign to Deus castorum corporum. ln claudi and 44
Deus castorum corporum and Benedicat te mus (p. 135) are placed after
the giving of the veil.

p. 138. Aooipe puella pallium. This is in Mi‘ssale Francorum, but not in
the leonine, Gelasian, or Gregorian sacramentarios. The whole of
the group of English books have it, but differ, as we have seen, as to
its position in relation to the other prayers. '

Effimde domine. This is in all the books of the group. ln Egb.
it is joined with Benedicat te conditor and Benedicat te deus, and its
pharapterk as a portion of the mass is not specifically stated, as in the
ater oo s.

pp. 138, 139. Benedictio uestis uiduae. The first of the three prayers of
this section is mentioned above, in the notes on the Benedictio uestium
ssirginir. The other two are the forms for the same purpose in Mihsale

raucorum.

p. r 39. consolare domine. This is the Benedictio viduas of the Gelasian
Sacramentary : it appears also in Mi'ssale Francorum. Egb. joins with
it the prayer Deus castitatis amator, which is also found in the Gelasian
Sacramentary. The prayer Da quaesumus is not apparently to be
found in any of the early Sacramentaries: it is not identical with that
which in Hittorp’s Ordo Romanus is combined with Consolare.

Deus castorum corporum. See the note on the longer form (p. 137)
from which this form may be said to be derived.

p. 140. Eamulnm tuam. This appears in the supplementary art of the
Gregorian Sacramentaries, as aprayerudanci'llas dei'uelan as. It has
thessapivedtitle in Egb., where it is arranged for use either for Virgins
or or 1 ows.

pp. 140-147. consecratio Regis. The Order for the Consecration of a
King contained in Rob. is that known as the Second English Order.
lt is found also, with very slight variation, in D., Τ., 146, and in
Menard’s Codex Rutoldi, and in an imperfect form (parts of the text
being now lost) in the fragments cited as Claud.² A peculiar recension
of it, with considerable changes and additions, occurs in 44 This has
been edited for the Society by Dr. Wickham Legg (H.B.S., vol xix.);
