¹92 NOTES.

Ab episeopo siue abbata inchoetur letania. The litany is given
at length in Claud.² and 44; Lan. and the Missal have only the K yrie,
Pater noster, and preces. The four prayers which follow are in all the
books of this group.

p. 132. Deus bonarum uirtutum. ln Claudi, Lan, T., and 44 Deus qui
vestimentum precedes this: so also in D. and 146. Both prayers are in
a rather longer form in all the books except Rob. and the Missa] ε in 44
Deus bonarum uirtutum is expanded 10 a great length.

p. 133. 'Adesto domina Claud.2 allans, and 44 directs,a respond at this

ornt.
pDeus qul renunciantibus. This prayer is also in D. and 146, but
in a different position. T. and 44 insert after it another prayer (suscipe
quaesumus domine), which is also in D. and 146.

clementissime dominator. Before this, Claudi, T., and 44 insert
11111111ῗέ11 ‘tattittttttti..litlethittittt
in D. After them 44 adds some further prayers and benedictions.

pp. 135-140. The forms for the Benediction 01 Virgins and Widows and
of their habits, which are contained in these pages, are made up of
material which appears in Egbert's Pontifical‚ with slight variation, in
a less definite arrangement. ln the forms for the Benediction 01 Virgins,
Claud.² and 44, while using much 01 the same material which is employed
in Rob., arrange the prayers in a different order. On the other hand,
Lan, D., 146, and T. agree on the whole with Rob., but they add one
prayer (Te invocamus) which Rob. alone omits. ln the sections relating
to Widows all the seven books are in agreement, save that part of the
form is now wanting in Claud.2 The forms in Claud. difier in order
from tlpose in the other books, but are also made up of material found
in E .

p. 135. Bgenadiotio uestium uirginis The two prayers which make up
this section stand first in all the seven books. Egb. assigns thern
(having the first in a slightly different form) 10 the blessing of the habit
either of Virgins or of Widows. The two are found together, as the

. Benedictio vestium nz'rginn vel viduae, in the supplementary part of

the Gregorian Sacramentaries (see Muratori, Lit. Rom. Vet, ri. 183,

184): the first is found in the same form which it has in Egb. (Deus

aeternorum) in the Gelasian Sacramentary, as the Benedictio westmun-
torum virpinis. ln this form, with the necessary variation, it appears
again in t e section as to the Widow's habit in the seven later books.

Benedicat te conditor. ln Egb. this is the first prayer of the
Benedictio virginis moniales, the second being Benedicat te deus, which
follows it in Rob. and the four books which agree with Rob. 11 is
found, together with the first clause 01 Benedicat te deus, in Musale
Francorum. Both in Missale Francorum and in Egb. it ends with a
clause, onritted 111 the later English books, which serves to link it with
the following benediction. 111 Claud.2 and 44 two other prayers (Omni-
potens sempiterne deus adiuua and T e innotamus) are placed before
Benedicat te conditor, which is made 10 precede the giving 01 the veil,
while Benedicat te deus is placed after that action.

p. 136. Omnipotens sempiterne deus adiuua. This, as hasbeen said,
is placed earlier 111 Claud.2 and 44, where it follows Deus bonarum. ln
Egb. it is separated from Deus bonarum by the formula for the giving
of the veil, and (like the forms which stand just before it) is made to
serve either for Virgins or for Widows. In Missole Francorum it is the
first prayer in the section relating to the Benedictm Virginum.

p. 137. Deus castorum eorporuna This is the principal benediction
in the corresponding sections of the Leonine and of the Gelasian
