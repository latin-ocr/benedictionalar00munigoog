evident that the orIginal purpose of it was to provide that in the case
of the consecration of a Pope two changes were to be made in the
Cemecrntio beginning Deus honorum omnium: (a) the insertion of
certain words between huic famulo tuo quem and adsummi sacerdotii
ministerium (see p. 126, line 10); and (b) the substitution of the word
pontificalem for episcopalem in another clause, where in some texts (as

in Rob.) the reading which in this section is prescribed as a special
variation has been adopted to the exclusion of the more ordinary
episcopalem (see p. 127, line 4). But the beginning of the prayer in
which the changes were to be made, the words preceding and following
the inserted and altered words, and the special words themselves have
been run together as though they formed a consecutive prayer. lt is
to be noted that while in Egb.‚ in Minard's Codex S. Eligit and in
Martene’s Ordo taken frorn Lan. and D.‚ the phrase for insertion runs,
Quem apostolicaesedis praesulem et primatem omnium qui in orbe
terrnrnm snnt sacerdotum nc universalis ecclessiae tuae doctorem dedisti,
it appears in Rob. in a modified form. The last part of the section is
also linked on to what precedes by the omission of tribuas and the inser-
tion of utin its place, and by the addition of ascendat after universam.
What the earlier use of the section in England may have been it would
be difficolt to say; but in the form which it assumes in Rob. it appears
also in later English Pontificais in the definite character of a prayer
for the bishop at his enthronement; and it seenrs probable that this
character is meant to belong to it in Rob. also, where it is followed by
the forms which in the rath-century Pontificals are combined with it
to make up the order of enthronement. In Egb. and the other books
of the group the same prayers follow the Additio in consecratienem.
In Egb. the benediction Spiritus sanctus septiformis follows that
beginning Populus te honoret, and is followed by the Super oblata of
the mass. D. and T. add some matter relating to the consecration of
one English Archbishop by the other3 and to the pallium (see Martene,
De Ant. Eecl. Rit, vol. ii. p. 41).

pp. 130, 131. Benedictio Abbatis. This section agrees with the corre-
sponding Order in Egb, Lan, and Ι), save that the prayer Super hunc
famulum ends in Egb. at gratiam tuae benedictiones. Claud.², Τ, 146,
and 44 have the same prayers, but add to them other matter, including
the delivery of ring and staff.

pp. 131-135. Ordinatio Monaohorum. Egb. does not contain this Order.
D. and 146 have a different Order (printed in Martene, De Ant. Eccl.
Rir, vol. ii. p. 163, from D.): this includes (in a longer form) the
prayers Dens benereem virtutum (p. 13²) and Deus qni vesteinentum
(p. 133), and also some other prayers which appear in Rob. or in other
books of the group which are akin to it in this section. The Order in
Rob. (save for some abridgement of rubrics) is practically identical
with that in the Missal of Robert of Jumieges (H.B.S.‚ vol. xi. pp. 280-
286), and nearly the same as that in Lan, claude, and T. ln 44 there
are some additione, and some of the prayers are expanded3 but the
general outline agrees with Rob. Marthae prints the Order from Lan.
and the Missal, noting the resemblance to Rob. (De Ant. Eccl. Rit, vol. ii.
p. 162). ln the Missai (and in Lan.) the only officiant mentioned is the
Abbot. The·12th·century Pontificals have an entirely different Order,
which appears in the book of the Abbot of Evesham (H.B.S.‚ vol. vi.
col. 28-34) and (in outline) in the Customary of S. Augustine's Abbey,
Canterbury (H.B.S.‚ vol. xxn). lt agrees with Lanfranc's Statnta.

p. 131. (lum autem nouitius‚ etc. Lan„ Claudt, 44, and the Missal of
Robert of Jumieges have a much fuller introduction. That in T. is

. different, resembling what is found in D.
