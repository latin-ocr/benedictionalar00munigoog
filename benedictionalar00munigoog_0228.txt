To the forms contained in the earliest sacramentaries all the books
of the group add directions or formuloe for the putting on of the stole
and for the anointing of the hands; all but Claud. and the Sidney
Sussex MS. for the delivery of the Gospel·book As to the place of
these additions there is some variation.

The first four prayers of Rob. (pp. 120, 121) are common to all but
Egb, which has a somewhat different form of the first, and omits the
third. This group of prayers may he said to represent the matter
common to the Leonine and Gelasian Sacramentaries‚ though the first
three are not exactly the same as the initial prayers in either of these
books, and the second is not contained in either. The two prayers
which stand last in Rob. (p. 122) represent the addition made to the
Leonine form in the Gelasian Sacramentary. In Rob. the added
ceremonies are placed between these two portions, which in the other
books of the group are consecutive. ln Egb, Lan, and D. the putting
on of the stole (accompanied or followed by the form beginning In
nomine sanctae Trinitatis 1) and the delivery of the Gospels are placed
at the beginning, before the prayer Oremus dilectissimi. In Claud, T.,
and the Sidney Sussex MS. the added ceremonies are deferred till after
the prayers, where T. places the delivery of the Gospel before that of
the stole.² In all except Rob. the Consecraiia mannum comes last. T.
join)s to it a prayer which is not in the earlier books (Densqui Moysi,
etc..

p. 119. Diaconus eum ordinetur, etc. This rubric is taken from the

cnm ordinatur directions as to the delivery of the stole and the Gospel-
books, and after this proceed Deinde salus epe'scapns, etc.
