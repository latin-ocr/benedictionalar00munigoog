NOTES. 181

the “ hidding prayer '’ Deum universitatis. ln 146 and 44 they are

separated, as in Rob., by the second ancinting and the anthem Mane
surgens.

Vidit Iacob. Egb. has Ecce odor flliimoi. Ps. Fundamento,· D.
and Ramsey, Aedificavit Moyses. Ps. Magnus dominns.

singulare illud See above, note on p. 84. Rob., in placing this
and the following prayer at the last stage of the anointrng of the altar,
may be said to give them something of the special importance which
they have in Claud., though in a different way.

p. 86. Sanctificetur. Egb., Claud., D. omit this.

Tunc demum presul egrediens, etc. Egb., Claud., D., Lan. do not
make mention of any external anointing. D. has two anthems (O qnam
metuendus. Ps. Cantote domino . . . cantate, and Lapides. Ps. Can·
tate Domino . . . laudatio). Egb., Claud., and D. have no collects at
this point: Lan. has the two anthems, and places after the second of
them the two collects which appear in Rob. Ramsey has the same
anthems, but substitutes another collect for Omnipotens sempiterne oeus
effunde. It also provides an alternative anthem and collect for use
outside the church‚ si lrgreeafuerit. Egb. has no anthem at this point,
placing 0 quam metuendus just after the anointing of the walls: 146
assdnrlt1 agree with Rob. A later hand in 146 provides for awooden
cure.

p. 87. Domine ed te. Claud. and D. omit this anthem; Egb. omits both,
having employed Ecce odor at an earlier point (see note on p. 84).
Ramsey inserts after the first anthem the collect Omnipotens sempiterne
dens ep‘nnde (see last note).

Domine sancte pater clemens. Not at this point in Egb., Claud.,
D. Egb. has it earlier.

Dei patris omnipotentis misericordiam. The form of this rayer
shows it to have been originally the “hidding prayer'’ prece ing a
collect. All the books, however, contemplate its being treated as a
collect, preceded by Oramus, Flectamus genua, Leonte. D. alters it
into the form of a collect.

p. 88. Praefatio super· altare. Both in 44 aud in Ramsey another prayer
is inserted before this : the two forms are not identical

p. 89. Deinde teneant, etc. Egb., Claud., D., Lan. place this rubric (with
slight variation) at the head of the whole series of benedictions of
church fumiture, in which they include the two benedictions which
follow here in Rob. ’

Post haec uestiatur altare, etc. Egb., Claud., D., and Lan. post-
pone the vesting of the altar till after the enclosing of the relies. Lan.
has Ornavernnt here, but without any mention of vesting the altar.
Egb. places immediately after the Praefatio snper altare the authem
Confirma; then two forms for the Benedictio tabulae; then (as Oratio
post unctionem altaris) the prayer Maiestatem tuam, followedby the
rubric as to tbe benediction of church furniture, and the series of bene·
dictions for that purpose: at the end of this series it proceeds with the
order for the introduction of the relies Claud., D., and Lan. proceed
as Rob., except that Claud. and D. omit Ornaoernnt, and that all here
omit the collect Descendot. After Confirmo they place the rubric as to
benediction of the fumiture, and the series of benedictions, and then
proceed with the section which they entitle Ordo quomodo in sancta
Romano ecclesia reliquiae condantur. This is in the lullcst form iu
Lan. ; in D. it is abridged; that in Claud. is apparently a less developed
form. Some parts of the Order appear at a later point in Rob. But
Rob., 146, 44, and Ramsey regard the dedication of the church as being
completed, and insert the form of the commendation of the church‚
