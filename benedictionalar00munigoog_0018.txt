than that at which the name was inserted in the short Litany.
But, isit were only a question of the invocation of the saint in
preference to others os the Apostolic company, the increase
os his farne in connection with the relic at Croyland might
iurnish one sufficient reason lor the choice‚ while another might
be found in the fact that the relies, and presumably also the
intercessIon, of the Apostle were held to be os special efficacy
asa protection against lightning‚¹-a belief which might very
naturally have led to his being specially invoked at the dedica·
tion oi a new building. lt is less easy to account sor the later
insertion ol his name, apart from local considerations ol some
special kind.

Such local reasons, it would seem, were to be sound at
Canterbury, at a time somewhat later than that to which the
main body of the MS. has been assigned. It was in the time of
the Archbishop AEthelnoth (ic. alter 1019),and apparently before
the death of Canute (11th November, 1035), that the Queen
Emma gave to Christ Church, Canterbury, the arm os S. Bar-
tholomew, which she purchased from a Bishop of Βετιειιετιτο.2
If the addition of the saint's name was made at Canterbury,
alter the acquisition ol this relic, the insertion and the decora-
tion οἱ the name seem to be sufficiently explained. On this
hypothesis, the MS. must have remained in England at least
until the year 1020,-a point which, though it is lar from being
certain, ought perhaps to be taken into account in considering
the question ol its ownership.

This question has been the subject oi a good deal ol dis·
cussion. That the book was at some time the property of an
Archbishop named Robert seems to be generally admitted;
but there is a doubt whether the possessor was Robert of
Jurnieges, the Norman Archbishop os Canterbury, who was
driven from his see in 1052 and died at Jumieges in 1070, or
Robert ol Normandy‚ Archbishop of Rouen srom 990 to 1037.

On the recto of fol. 1 a hand, probably not earlier than the
seventeenth century, has written the title, “Benedictionarius
Roberti Archiepiscopi.'' After these words, something appears
to have been erased: The Abbe Saas‚ in the eighteenth
century, supplied the word “cantuariensis'' Dom Tassin, in
