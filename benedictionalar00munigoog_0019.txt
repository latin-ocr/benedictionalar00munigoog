PREFACE. xv

his criticism of Abbe SaaS, maintained that the word erased
had been “Rotomagensis.” He suggested that the erasure
had been made by Saas himself, and that a corresponding
alteration had been made in the inscription on the cover of the
book. Saas, in his reply, alleged that the erasure or erasures
had been made long before his own day, and that in supplying
the word ‘⁴ cantuariensis'’ he had followed the indication of
a still older inscription, which he had found on the inside of
the cover—‘⁴ Robertus cantuaritarum Archiepiscopus anno
Christi 1050.''1 Both disputants, apparently, agreed in iden·
tifying the book (then in the Cathedral Library at Rouen)
with a volume described as ‘⁶ Benedictionarius Roberti Archi-
episcopi '' in a list of the Cathedral books drawn up in the
time of Archbishop Godofredus (1111-1128): and Tassin argues
with much force that in such a list the designation “Robertus
Archiepiscopus'' is much more likely to indicate Robert the
Archbishop of Rouen than to refer to an Archbishop of Canter-
bury‚ who, though Norman by birth, had no special connection
with Rouen or with the Cathedral Church, where the list was
written. The evidence oi the note on which Abbe Saas based
his conjecture seems hardly to outweigh the probability in
favour of this interpretation of the list The form “ Cantuari·
tarum” does not suggest a very early date for the note in
which it occurs

At first sight, no doubt, Robert of Jumieges seems to be the
more likely of the two Archbishops to have been the means of
transferring an English Service-book to Normandy. We know
that he did so transfer the Sacramentary known as the “ Missal
of Robert of Jumieges,” which, like the “Benedictional,’' has
now found ahorne in the Public Library of Rouen.2 But he
was not, perhaps, very likely to have given the book to a church
with which he had no such close personal connection as he had
with the monastery of Jumieges, to which he gave the “Missal.”
On the other hand, Robert of Normandy is the more likely to
have given such a book to his own cathedral church; and he is
not unlikely to have become possessed of such a book either by
gift or by purchase. He was the brother oi Queen Emma, the
wife of Ethelred ΙΙ. and of Canute, and mother of Edward the
Confessor. On the assumption that the book was at first
the property of AEthelgar, it is to be noticed that the date of

¹ This inscription is not now to be found, having probably perished when the
volume was rebound. ·

² The Benedictional and the “ Missal '' are not unnaturally regarded, by those who
see them in the same library, as companion volumes. But they came to the Library
as parts of different collections. The ‘⁶ Missal ” carne from Jumieges, the ‘⁶ Bene·
dictigonal'' from the Cathedral Library, where it had apparently been since before
