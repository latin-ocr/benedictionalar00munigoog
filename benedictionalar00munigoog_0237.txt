NOTES. 197

statuta, omitting Audnti karissime quod. The answer to the question
with which this address ends (Itu ex totocorde volo in omnibus obedire
et consentire) is omitted in the text, probably by a clerical error.

p. 163. Vis per dei gratiam, etc. This comprehensive question is not
usually included in the series. Where it appears, it seems to take the ,
place of some other questions which are as a rule included, but here
omitted. The same arrangement appears in a Lyons Pontifieal, adapted
for use at Tarentaise, from which Martene extracts one of his Ordines
(De A nt. Eccl. Ret, vol. ii. p. 91).

Vis caetitatem . . . at in ea filios tuos enutrire? The first part
of this question ap ears in a shape but slightly different in a large
number of books: tie latter part is apparently at least unusual. It is
sometimes replaced simply by the words et docere: the Lyons Pontifical
already cited has et eam tibi subderes docere, with a further inquiry as to
the euforcement of the teaching in the caseos sacerdotes, diaconi, aud
ministri. Fe'lzbs may, of course, be taken as equivalent to subditos,-
but it seems most likely that the word had at first its ordinary sense,
and that its retention here is a caseos survival.

Vis beato Petro, etc. This question is not unfrequently omitted;
but its place is supplied by a question as to willingness to receive and
observe the traditions of the orthodox Fathers and the decretal
constitutions of the apostolic see.

Unicum et unum deum dei fllium. Some words seem to have
been accidentally omitted before this phrase. The usual form runs,
“Deum verum et hominem verum, proprium in utraque natura atque

erfectum, non adoptivum, nec phantasticum, unicum et unum,’' etc.

p. 1 4. Orodis panem, etc. This and the next question are eoncemed
with the acceptante of the definition against Berengarius, mentioned on
p. 155. Martene speaks of them as occurring in two Pontificals, one of
Rouen (perhaps this book), the other the Lyons Pontifical already cited.
They are found also in some English Pontificals (see Maskell, Monu-
menta Rz’tualia Ecclesiae Α nglicanae, vol. ii. p. 265, ed. 1882).

Adesto deus. This and the following collect appear in the earlier
Ord0(p.1 125) as prayers said over the bishop-elect when heis presented
before the Gospel: in the Rouen Order they seem to be intended to
serve as the collects of the mass which begins after the examination is
concluded. This is the case in the Besanqon Pontifical, where they are
separated from the Consecratio, which in the earlier Ordo seems to
follow them immediately, by the Epistle, graii, Gospel, offertory, and
secret. The secret, Hanc egitur,- and post-communion of the mass
are the same as in the Besaneon Pontifical.

p.165. Ad pollicem consecrandum. This is intended to supplement (or
possibly, as apparently in Hittorp's Ordo Romanus, to replace) the
Consecratio manuum of the earlier Ordo (p. 128). Where it appears it
is generally added to the Consecratio manuum, as it is in the Besanqon
Pontifical: and this is probably the intention with which it is inserted
here. The Lyons Pontifical (Martene, De Ant. Eccl. Rit, vol. ii. p. 93)
has a disquisition on the different modes of anointing the hands.

Benedictio battuli. This is apparently a substitute for the metrical
form of the earlier Ordo (p. 128), the use of which was apparently not
general. The form given here appears in the Besanqon Pontifical.

Benedictio anuli The earlier Ordo has no form for blessing
the ring. This (which is found also in the Besancon Pontifical) is
apparently intended to supply what according to later usage would be

a ‹diederhtipotene sempiterne deus qui distinetie. This form borrows

some of its phrases from the form provided for use at the enthronement
