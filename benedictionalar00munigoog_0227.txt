NOTES. 187

Ordination forms, beginning with the Ostiarius, ending with the Pres-
byter, and including both the Acolyte and the Subdeacon

The omission of the Acolyte from the numeration in Claud. and the
Sidney Sussex MS. is possibly to be connected with a section‚ De septem
gradibus ecclesiae quos adimplevit Christus, which appears in Egb.,
Lan, and D. ln this section the list begins with the Ostiarius and ends
with the Bishop: the Acolyte is not mentioned at all. Lau. has also a
section‚ not found in the other hookS, treating of the orders by way of
question and answer, where the answer to the question Dic milri, gradus
ecclesiasticique! sunt? is Octo .· and where the eight orders begin with
the Ostiarius and end with the Presbyter, the number being made up
by including (as the second order) the Psalmcita.

p. 115. Psalmiste . . . potest Egb. 3ηά some others insert (before potest)
posteaquam coarchidiacono instructus fuerit. These additional words
are not in the Gelasian Sacramentary or in the ordinary text of the
Statnta Ecclesiae Antiqua, whence this section comes. T. adds some
words to the formula of admission.

p. 116. Et tradet ei diaconus bostium ecclesie. This is an addition to
the text of the Statnto, not in the Gelasian Sacramentary. Egb. and
some others have archidiaconus. T. adds that the archdeacon is to
Leaddhim to the door and bring him back to the hishop for the

ene iction.

Accipe et esto. T. inserts before this, at the end of the rubric, Vide
ut quod ore cantas, etc. (as above in Rob. for the Psalmista).

Benedictio lectoris. Egb. and Lan. have a form of bidding prayer
before this, which the other books omit. lt is not in the Gelasian
Sacramentary or in Missale Francorum.

p. 117. Accolitus oum ordinatur, etc. T. adds formulae for the delivery
of the instruments. The Gelasian Sacramentary, which has the extract
from the Statnta relating to the Acolyte, omits the forms of henediction
which follow in Rob. Nor are they in Missale Francorum, which has
another form. The Sidney Sussex MS. and Claud. have only oue
benediction, which seems to be made up from the two in Egb., Lan,
D., and Rob. The second benediction, as it appears iu these four, is
evidently corrupt. lu T. some attempt seems to have been made to
amend it; the 12th-century Pontificals alter it considerably.

p. 118. Ordo qualiter . . . ordinandi sunt. A section similar to this
occurs in the Gelasian Sacramentary before the forms for the Ordina-
tion of Priests and Deacons. A similar clause occurs in Egb., Claud,
Lan, D., 3ηά the Sidney Sussex MS. T. has a correspondiug heading,
but the two pages following it are left blank. In Egb. the section is
placed at the beginning of the series of Ordination forms, having the
heading, Incipit ardo qualeter in Romana ecclesia presbiteri diacona sub-
diaconi vel ceteri ordines clericorum benedicendi sunt, followed by matter
answering to the contents of the section in Rob., and hy various rules
3ηά statements as to Ordination, some of which are found also iu Claud.
and D. ln Lan. the corresponding section is placed between the forms
for Subdeacons and those for Deacons. lu Claud. and D, as in Rob.,
the section comes before the forms for Subdeacons ; but in D. no
mention of Subdeacons is made in the heading. ln T. the heading

(as in Egb. with the addition of de sacres ordinibus after ordo, and of
the words a domna pontefice sedis apostolicae after clericorum) precedes
the forms for Subdeacons. Rob. stands alone in making no mention
of the Romana ecclesia in the heading of the section.

ln xii. lectionibus. All the other books of the group (T. excepted,
which has not the passage) add ad sanctum Petrum.

Antequam euangelium legetur. Egb., Lan.,and Claud. have(like
