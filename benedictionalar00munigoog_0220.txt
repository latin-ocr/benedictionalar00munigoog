are several minor differentes in the selection of psalms. ln this matter
Ramsey agrees with Rob. so far as the antherus and collects for the
interior circuits are concerned: D. substitutes Exurgat for Laudate:
44 and 146 have at the same point Laudate dominum de caeles, which is
probably the psalm indicated by the corrector of Rob. (see p. 80. note).
As to the external circuits, 146, 44, and Ramsey differ from Rob. and
from each other ; Egb. provides only one anthem (Asperges me) ,· Claud.
has none: D.‚ though enjoining only one circuit, for which it provides
the anthem Fundamenta, provides a second anthem (Vidit Jacob
scalam. Ps. Deus noster refugium) to be sung dum ascendant sacer-
dotes spargentes super eulnn'na ecclesiae. This is followed by the
collect Deus qui Jacob sarnulo. In Rob., Lan, 146, 44, and Ramsey
the anthem Vidit Jacob is omitted, but the collect, which evidently
belongs to it, remains: in Lan. the collect is described (probably by a
clepicpl erffr) as an anthem. Egb. and Claud. omit both the anthem
an t eco ect.

nt woden de lpuo altari, etc. This direction is found in all the
texts with slight variation of expression3 but they show a good deal
of divergence in respect uf the number and order of the anthems and
collects which follow. The prayer Dens sanctificationum was probably
the consecratory form of one of the early Ordines on which the various
texts are based (as it is in the Ordo of M agistretti's Milanese Pontificai),
having before it, as a prelimin collect, Deus qui loca. The Prefatio
in medio ecclesiaehas supersede itin this ca acity‚ but Dens santifica-
tionum has been retained in the majority ofpthe texts: and to this the
divergence is probably due. D. discards Deus qni loca and has before
the Preface one anthem (Benedictus es) and one prayer (Deus randifi-
cationum). Claud., Rob., Lan, 146 keep both Deus qni loco and Deus
sanctificationum: so also does Egb., but it preserves the tradition of
making Deus qui loca precede the consecratory form by placing it just
before the Prelace. It has Fundamenta as the anthem before Deus
sanctificationum, and places before Deus qui loca two anthems‚ Benedic
domine (not identical with the anthem beginning with the same words
in Rob.) and Domus mea domm orationib. ln Ramsey and 44 the
system of anthems and prayers is further developed‚ and there are three.
anthems (Remedia, Benedictus es, and Tu domine uniuersorum), each
followed by a prayer. The additional prayer (Dens qui caelestium) is
linked with Benedt‘c in 44, with Benedictus es in Ramsey, Dens qui loca
being linked with Benedic in Ramsey and with Benedictus es in 44 ι in
both, Deus sanctificationum is the last prayer before the Preface.
