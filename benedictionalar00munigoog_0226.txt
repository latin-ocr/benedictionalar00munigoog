pp. 115-130. Ordo de neuris Ordinibus benedicendis. The Ordination
forms contained in this Pontifical are in general agreement with those
found in the earlier books already referred to-Egb., Lan, D.‚ and Claud.
The forms of the Sidney Sussex College MS. Δ. 5. ις (c. 1090-1110)
appear, from the account given of them by Mr. Christopher Words-
worth in his appendix to the Pontifical of David de Bernham, to be so
nearly identical with those of Claud. that what is said of the one MS. in
the following notes will equally apply to the other, save for the fact that

ζ while a small portion of the form for the Consecration of Bishops is
to be found in Claud, the form is uot represented in the Siduey Sussex
ΜΒ.1 The forms in the Douai MS. 67 (the Pontifical of S. Thomas,
cited below as T.) agree closely with those of the early group. Those
of the two Corpus Christi College MSS. (146 and 44) show more
divergence, and can hardly be reckoned among the earliest group of
English forms, though they are, of course, in agreement with that group
as regards the greater part of their contents. The divergeuce in 44 is
more marked than that in 146.

In the earliest group of English Pontificals the back-bone of the
Ordination forms is evidently the same with the forms which are to be
found in the Gelasian Sacramentary.² The basis of their rubrics is the
series of extracts from the S tatuta Ecclesiae Antiqua: the basis of their
prayers consists almost entirely of the prayers combined in the Gelasian
Sacramentary. lu some cases particular members of the group follow
a text not identical with that of the Gelasian Sacramentary: in a lew
instances there are variations which seem to be due to intentional
alteration or attempts to emend the ordinary text 3 but the variations of
reading are for the most part not of a kind such as to require special
mention in these notes. With regard to the matter which is added to
the Gelasian forms the members of the group are for the most part in
agreement as to its substance: they differ, though not very widely, as
to its arrangement.

One rather curious though not very important variation is that which
concerns the numeration of the various orders. ln Rob. numbers are
given in the headiugs of the sections (eg. Ordinatio hostiarii .· incipit
pn'mus gradus) : and the Episcopate is septimus gradus, this result
being reached by the non-assignment of any number to the Suhdeacon.
ln Claud, Lan, T., and the Siduey Sussex MS. the numbers (in most
cases) are given at the end of the sections (eg. Hucusque prtinus
gradus),· but the numeration is not regular. All four make the order
of Exorcist tertius gradus, that of Deacon quintus gradum but they
differ as to the intermediate steps. Claud. leaves the order of Acolyte
unnumbered, marking the Subdiaconate as quartus gradus: Lan. and
the Sidney Sussex MS. number neither: T. numbers the Subdiaconate
as quintus gradus (repeating the number for the Diaconate) ; but this
last seems to be a slip of the scribe, since at the end of the form for
Priests there appears Hucusque vii. gradus. The Episcopate therefore
is not reckoned in T. as it is in Rob., and apparently in Claud. and the
Siduey Sussex MS, separately, as one of seven degrees. This is in
accordance with the reckoning of a list which in T. precedes the

¹ Claud. has only the three initial prayers, which are placed apart from the other
Ordination forms with the heading, Benedicttb Episcoparum.
