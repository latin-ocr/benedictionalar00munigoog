172 NOTES.

In dle Paschae. The first of these forms is common to all the series.
The second (Deus qui calcatis) appears in Egb. as a Benedictio in
Pascha ad Vespernm, with several additional clauses, and in AEth. lt
has only the first clause in common with a form contained in several of
the other series for the Saturday of Easter week. 1

p. 17. ln dealing with the benedictions from Easter Day to Rogation Sunday
some of the collections do not assign the benedictions to particular
days; others make an assignment differing more or less from that of
Rob. Of these differences it does not seem necessary to take minute
account. The order in Rob. is in general the same as that in Egh, the
only exception being on the Saturday of Easter week.

{epia secunda. This is common to groups A and B (except 326)
an am.

Peste tertia. ’lhis and the other benedictions to Penio. sem
inclusive are common to groups A and B and Pam.

p. 18. Benedictio in sabbato. This is found in AEth. Egb. and several

p. 20. In Interrie Maiore. Not in Pam, Vat, or 329. The rest have it,
though not generally with this title. Egb. has de ieiunio uel Dom. iiii.
AEth. and Lan, employ the term Laetania Mae‘or, as does D. The last
seems to intend the benediction so headed for use on the Sunday‚ as the
Rogation benedictions which follow are for the Monday and Tuesday.

In tertia Faria. In D. and Th. 3 the latter assigns it to the Sunday.

assigned to the 20th Sunday after Pentecost.

Most of the benedictions which Rob. provides for the Sundays from
Pentecost to Advent are common to groups A and Β, or to the majority
of the collections included in those groups. Th. has fewer of the set
than the rest, and some of those which it includes 'appear in it as
benedictiones quotidianae, not as assigned to these Sundays, orto any
day in particular. These, and others of the set in Rob. appear also
