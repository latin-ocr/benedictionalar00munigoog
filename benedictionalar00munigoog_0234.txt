p. 141. In diebus eius. The diversitybetween the different MSS. in the
textoftbisprayer,some(beginninglndiebustua'r)makingitanaddress
to the King, others (as Rob.) making ita precatory benedictina, is
noticed by Dr. Wrckham Legg. The prayer seems to be really part
of a long form, ofwhich Te invocamus is tbe first portiom thelatter
part has been altered so asto avoid the abrupt and unusual beginning
which is found in Rob. This, though its awkwardness would nm have
been marked if the prayer were simply diwded between two or more
of the assistant bishops, one of whom began his portion at In da'ebus
eius, must bave been made more noticeable when Deus qui populis
was inserted between the divisions. The various stages are illustrated
by different MSS. In the tttb-century Ordo, printed from a MS. at
Milan by Magistretti in the appendix to his Pontificalc Eccl. Medr'ol.
Sacc. r'x. (p. 113), the prayer is unbrolren. ln the leofric Missal itis
divided into two parts, the second beginning at In diebus eius; but
Deus quipopulrr does not appear. ln Egb. Deus quipopulis is inserted
between the two portione 3 and in some of the later group the beginning
of the second portion is altered, and the remainder of the prayer modified

p. 148. consecutio Reginae. This Order is generally attached to the
Second English Order of the King's Coronation in the MSS. which
contain it In Pontificale Lnnaletense (which in the King's Corona-
tion agrees with Eghert's Pontifical) the Queen’s Coronation appears
apart from the Order for the King. Egbert's Pontifical provides no
form for the crowning of the Queen3 nor does the Leofric Missal ln
44 the Order for the Queen has shared in the process of revision applied
to that for the King. For the variations in the different books of the
group reference may, as before, be made to Dr. Wickbam Legg’s notes
in T lirae Coronation Orders (H.BtS, vol. xia). ’

Tm remaining contents of the volume consist of later additions, some
nearly contemporary, and perhaps written while the book was still in
England 3 others of later date, the most important being forms for use
in the province of Rouen.

pp. 149-151. The forms relating to marriage belong to the two periods of
the history of the MS. The mass Ad sponsam benedicendam was
probably written in England. The benedictions for use in the mass,
the catch-words of the post-communion, the second post-communion
(or super populum), and the portion relating to the sponsals were
probably written in Normandy, but contain nothing distinctive. The
mass Ad sponsas benedicendas in the Mirsnl of Robert os Jumiiges
(H.B.S., vol. xi.) has the same collect, secret, and preface as Rob. lt
has two forms ad complendum, the second of which (placed after the
benediction Deus qui potestate, and¹ probably really a super populum) is
the same as the post-communion of Rob. The Epistle and Gospel are
not those most commonly found. As to the benedictions and other

by the symbol T. is in Dr. Wickham Legg’s notes cited as Dou. ; that lrnown as the
