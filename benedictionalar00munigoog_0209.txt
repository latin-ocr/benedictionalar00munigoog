NOTES.

ΤΗΕ Benedictional which forms the first portion of the MS. is divided into
two sections, one containing the benedictions of the T emporale, the other
those of the Sanctorule with the addition of ferial benedictions, and of a
small number os benedictions for special occasions. Each section includes,
besides the “Episcopal benedictions'’ sor use at Mass, certain forms of
benediction employed on particular days. The forms sor blessing the Ashes
on Ash Wednesday, the Palms on Palm Sunday, and the Oils and Chrism
on Maundy Thursday are in the first section; the second includes a form
for blessing the Candles on the feast of the Purification, and is closed by a
form for the Reconciliation of Penitents.

The “ Episcopal benedictions’' per anni circulum are almost all to be
sound,'with no great amount of variation as regards their position or their
text, in the Benedictional of S. AEthelwold. A large proportion of them are
also in the Pontifical os Egbert. This agreement is less marked in the
benedictions of the Sanctorale. The corresponding portion of the Pontifical
of S. Dunstan, though not always agreeing with our MS, is sor the most
part in accord with it, where the two provide benedictions for the same day
or the same purpose; but S. Dunstan's Pontifical provides in some cases
additional forms. The same is the case with Pontzficale Lanaletensc.
