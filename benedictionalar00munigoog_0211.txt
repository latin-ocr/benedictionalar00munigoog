first of two forms for Sexagesima.

Dom. sexagesimae. Common to groups A and B. The general
’ reading in the first clause substitutes nasse for magna. Egb. and Lan.
agree with Robert.

In quinquagesima. Common to groups A and B ς but Egb. (having-
no form for Quinquagesima) assigns this one to Ash Wednesday.

Benedictio cinerum. See Missal af Rabcrt af Jumiiges, p. 61, or
Leofra'c Missal, p. 204. The form is in Lan.

p. 10. Item elie.. This is not in the lida'ssal of Rabcrt af Jumz'igen but
affl.ffleffifflwffrfflfflnffl M.,·w.‚ Th. AEth. has it
as an alternative forrn for the second Sunday 111 Lent; Th for Ash
Wednesday and the following days infra hebdomadam.

divides the first clause ¹(making four); and D. M. W. also divide the
first clause, but omit that which is the third in Egb. and Rob.

. p. 11. Dom. ii. in XL. This is common to all. AEth.‚ 326, 329, give it to
Dom. iii. ; O. to Dom. parma, but has only three between this and Palm
Sunday. Vat. does not distinguish the Sundays in Lent for this
pusspgnsffist 111 XL. Comnion to all but AEth.

p. 12. Benedictio ad remos palmarum. All the forms which appear here
for the blessing of the palms appear (with others) in the fuller order of
Pontzficalc Lanalatense. The first (beginning Augefidcm) and second
are in Egbert's Pontifical, p. 135. The fourth is set before the mass of
the day in O. (see Muratori, Lit. Ram. Vei, ii. 51); the third has the
same position in the Lcafric Missal, p. 90.

p. 13. Benedictio ipso die ad Missam. This is common to all the series.
Alia de passione domini. Common to all but Th, 326, Leofr., 329.
consecratio chrismatis et olel. This text is closely related to the

parallel portion of Egbert’s Pontifical (p. 120), which seems to have been
derived from an early Orda Romanus. But the text of Rob. omits the
mention of the Lateran which appears in Egb., and the mention os the
cardinal deacon. lt also modifies in some other respects the wording
of the rubrics. The order in Lan. agrees more closely with Egb.

p. 15. Benedictio ad Mandatum. Common to all but Th„ 326, 339.

p. 16. Benedictio in sabbato Sancto. This is one of two forms in AEth,
but is notin any of the others.
